                            <p><em>Prelude: I&#39;m going to assume you&#39;ve got the database somewhere locally that you can work with, I wouldn&#39;t recommend doing it against a production database. We&#39;re not doing anything destructive against it but better safe than sorry!.</em></p>
<p>The scenario is that I&#39;m wanting to be able to visualise the revision history of my posts in FunnelWeb as Git commits, each new revision of a post should be a new commit. The history order should match the date that posts were created (or edited) so that it doesn&#39;t look like just a dump into Git, it looks like actual history.</p>
<p>Without doing a full Git primer there&#39;s one really important aspect of Git that you need to be aware of. Git is basically a small linux file system so with file system theory under our belt we should know that there&#39;s a date associated with files (or in this case, commits). So at least <em>in theory</em> we should be able to control when a commit happened right? After all I&#39;ve got posts from 2010 and I&#39;d like those commits to reflect that.</p>
<p>So armed with a bit of knowledge and <a href="http://twitter.com/shiftkey">Brendan Forster&#39;s skype handle</a> I started digging.</p>
<h1>It&#39;s a date</h1>
<p>Since my work on the time machine is running behind schedule (snap!) it&#39;s time to get an understanding of date&#39;s in Git. Each commit in Git will have two dates associated with it, <code>author date</code> and <code>committer date</code>, and there&#39;s an important difference between these two dates.</p>
<p><strong>Author date</strong> is the date when a commit was <em>originally authored</em> in the source repository.</p>
<p><strong>Committer date</strong> is the date when a commit was <em>applied to the current repository</em>.</p>
<p>This is the important bit of information, generally speaking these two dates are the same <strong>but they don&#39;t have to be</strong>. Say I create a patch file from my repository and send it to you, this will contain an <em>author date</em>, which is the date that <strong>I</strong> created the commit, and in my repository it matches the <em>commit date</em>. At some future point in time you&#39;re going to add that patch to your repository and when you do that you&#39;ll receive my <em>author date</em> but you&#39;ll have a different <em>commit date</em>, for you see the date that you committed it to the repository has changed, but the commit itself hasn&#39;t (if it did the whole commit would be invalid). <a href="http://alexpeattie.com/blog/working-with-dates-in-git/">A more in-depth write up can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>And this is where the power comes from, you can manipulate these dates. This means that I can extract my dates from FunnelWeb and author commits of a particular point in time, but commit them whenever makes sense.</p>
<p><em>Side note: General wisdom says you shouldn&#39;t mess around with the committer date, only the author date.</em></p>
<h1>Manipulating Git</h1>
<p>Well now that we know that we can, at least in theory, manipulate our Git history to match the information that I&#39;d like it to be, the question is how?</p>
<p>A quick search found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/454734/how-can-one-change-the-timestamp-of-an-old-commit-in-git">this on Stackoverflow</a>, neat-o I can do something like this:</p>
<pre class="highlighted"><code class="brainfuck">&gt;&gt; <span class="comment">git</span> <span class="comment">commit</span> <span class="literal">-</span><span class="literal">-</span><span class="comment">amend</span> <span class="literal">-</span><span class="literal">-</span><span class="comment">date="</span>&lt;<span class="comment">Date</span> <span class="comment">from</span> <span class="comment">my</span> <span class="comment">post</span> <span class="comment">revision</span>&gt;<span class="comment">"</code></pre>
<p>Well isn&#39;t that nice, the command line exposes what I want, but either having to manually run the commands on the CLI or calling the CLI fro mcode is not a particularly pleasent an idea.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://libgit2.github.com/">LibGit2</a> or more specifically <a href="https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp">LibGit2Sharp</a>. If you&#39;ve done anything with Git programmatically you&#39;re probably familiar with these libraries. LibGit2 is an implementation of the Git core commands but being written in C it&#39;s not that much fun for .NET developers so that&#39;s where LibGit2Sharp comes in and it&#39;s what we&#39;ll be using.</p>
<h1>Exporting out data</h1>
<p>I&#39;ll get back to Git in a moment as there&#39;s something important we need to do before we can work with Git and that&#39;s getting us some data.</p>
<p>For this I&#39;m going to use <a href="https://github.com/SamSaffron/dapper-dot-net">Dapper</a> which is a light-weight ORM to talk to the FunnelWeb database, but use whatever works best for you. The important part here is <em>how</em> we run our code.</p>
<p>Well there&#39;s an obvious option, we could go <code>File -&gt; New Console Application</code> and get cracking, NuGet install our dependencies, etc.</p>
<p>Nah console applications are so 2012, instead I&#39;m going to use <a href="http://scriptcs.net/">ScriptCS</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven&#39;t heard of ScriptCS don&#39;t fret, it&#39;s a very new platform. ScriptCS is the brain child of <a href="https://twitter.com/gblock">Glenn Block</a>, which is taking his learnings from being heavily involved in Node.js of recent and bringing that to the .NET world. Basically making a way which you can execute a C# file without the need for Visual Studio, the C# compiler or any of those tools we&#39;re use to as .NET developers. Check out <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ProjectlessScriptedCWithScriptCSAndRoslyn.aspx">Scott Hanselmans post on the topic</a> if you want to learn more.</p>
<p><em>Note: You&#39;ll need ScriptCS version 0.5.0 at least as you need <a href="https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/pull/250">my pull request</a> included.</em></p>
<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>Now we have the idea sorted out, I&#39;m going to start with a ScriptCS project which will use a Dapper to get our data out and LibGit2Sharp to push it into Git, seems nice and simple really. Let&#39;s break this down into the smaller parts.</p>
<h2>Opening our Git repo</h2>
<p>The first step in our process will be to open up the Git repo so we can work against it. I&#39;ve created a migrator folder which my migrator will reside within and then I&#39;ll go create a new file called <code>app.csx</code> which is my ScriptCS file (note the <code>csx</code> extension).</p>
<p>I&#39;ll need a using for <code>LibGit2Sharp</code> and then I&#39;m going to create a method which will resolve our Git repository. So my file now looks like this:</p>
<pre class="highlighted"><code class="cs"><span class="keyword">using</span> LibGit2Sharp;

<span class="keyword">static</span> Repository InitOrOpen(<span class="keyword">string</span> path) {
    <span class="keyword">var</span> gitBasePath = Repository.Discover(path);
    <span class="keyword">if</span> (gitBasePath == <span class="keyword">null</span>)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="string">"And we're creating a new git repo people!"</span>);
        <span class="keyword">return</span> Repository.Init(path);
    }
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="string">"Found existing repo, keep on trucking"</span>);
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> Repository(gitBasePath);
}

<span class="keyword">using</span> (<span class="keyword">var</span> repo = InitOrOpen(<span class="string">@"C:\_Code\my-repo"</span>)) {
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="string">"It's time to rock and rooooooooll"</span>);
}</code></pre>
<p>So my method <code>InitOrOpen</code> will take a path to a folder which is to be our Git repository. In the method it&#39;ll use the <code>Discover</code> method of the <code>Repository</code> class which will locate the Git repository for the current folder or any of its parents. This means that I don&#39;t have to pass the repository root, which works well for me using DocPad as I want to put my posts in <code>src\documents\posts</code> where my repository root is where the <code>src</code> folder exists.</p>
<p>The result of <code>Discover</code> will be the path which the Git repository resides in, as a string, which is null if there was no repository found. Based on that result we can choose to initialise a new Git repository, <code>Repository.Init(path)</code>, or open the repository at the discovered path, <code>new Repository(gitBasePath)</code>. This <code>Repository</code> object is what we&#39;ll use to interact with Git from .NET.</p>
<p>Lastly the file will call the method in a <code>using</code> block which in turn just dumps out that we opened the repository.</p>
<h2>Package.config</h2>
<p>Before we can run this ScriptCS file we&#39;ll need get LibGit2Sharp <em>installed</em>, so how do we go about it... <a href="http://nuget.org">NuGet</a> of course!</p>
<p>For this we&#39;ll need a <code>package.config</code> file which defines our NuGet packages. Here&#39;s where we&#39;re at:</p>
<pre class="highlighted"><code class="xml"><span class="pi">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">packages</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">package</span> <span class="attribute">id</span>=<span class="value">"LibGit2Sharp"</span> <span class="attribute">version</span>=<span class="value">"0.11.0.0"</span> <span class="attribute">targetFramework</span>=<span class="value">"net45"</span> /&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">packages</span>&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>Now we just need to run the ScriptCS file and our little app will do some logging out of messages!</p>
<p><em>Note: When I was writing this I came across a problem, LibGit2Sharp expects the native Git assemblies to be in the same folder as LibGit2Sharp&#39;s assembly. In a .NET app this is done by copying the <code>NativeBinaries</code> folder from the NuGet package into the <code>bin</code> folder as a post-build event in the csproj file. Since we don&#39;t have a csproj in ScriptCS you need to manually copy that folder.</em></p>
<h2>Preping our data</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not going to go into depth as to how to get your data out of your database to be pushing into Git, that&#39;ll somewhat depend on the database and ORM you&#39;re working with, you can find that from <a href="https://github.com/aaronpowell/aaronpowell.github.io/blob/master/_migrator/app.csx#L25-L46">here</a> in my source code.</p>
<p>What is important to know is that ScriptCS <strong>doesn&#39;t</strong> support <code>dynamic</code> in C#, so you&#39;ll need to create a class which represents the object you&#39;re pulling out of the database (the reason for this is at present <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/roslyn.aspx">Roslyn</a>, which ScriptCS uses to do its execution doesn&#39;t support it). I&#39;ve done this by creating a <a href="https://github.com/aaronpowell/aaronpowell.github.io/blob/master/_migrator/Post.csx">Posts.csx</a> file that is then loaded into ScriptSC.</p>
<p>But once we&#39;ve got our data out of our database it&#39;s time to push it into Git.</p>
<h2>Git it in ya</h2>
<p>We have our Git repository, we have our data, it&#39;s time to do something about joining the two things together. Remember I said that I wanted each revision in my FunnelWeb database to be an individual commit in Git? Well that will be quite easy to do. The object model that I have brought back out of FunnelWeb respects that, each object is a snapshot of the post at a particular point in time. Next I&#39;m going to have to do a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the comma-separated list of tags into an array</li>
<li>Clean up my URI schema (in FunnelWeb it was very free-flowing, I want to normalize it a bit to the standard <code>YYYY-MM-DD-name</code> format)<ul>
<li>But I don&#39;t want to break my existing SEO so I need to be able to track those old links and 301 them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a file doesn&#39;t exist yet create a new file, otherwise update the existing one<ul>
<li>This is where it&#39;s really cool, since we&#39;ll just override the existing file and Git is pretty smart about diff-detection it&#39;ll only track what changed between each version so we can then get nice clean diffs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now DocPad uses the fairly common YAML-style meta-data headers, but it also supports something they wrote specifically called <code>cson</code> which is a CoffeeScript version of JSON. Since I&#39;ve always found YAML a pain I&#39;m going to use that for my post meta data headers.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start writing our file to disk then:</p>
<pre class="highlighted"><code class="avrasm">foreach (var item <span class="keyword">in</span> items) {
    var tags = item<span class="preprocessor">.Tags</span><span class="preprocessor">.Split</span>(<span class="string">','</span>)
        <span class="preprocessor">.Select</span>(<span class="built_in">x</span> =&gt; <span class="built_in">x</span><span class="preprocessor">.Trim</span>())
        <span class="preprocessor">.Where</span>(<span class="built_in">x</span> =&gt; !string<span class="preprocessor">.IsNullOrEmpty</span>(<span class="built_in">x</span>))<span class="comment">;</span>
    var uriParts = item<span class="preprocessor">.Path</span><span class="preprocessor">.Split</span>(<span class="string">'/'</span>)<span class="comment">;</span>

    if (uriParts<span class="preprocessor">.Count</span>() &gt; <span class="number">1</span>) {
        tags = tags<span class="preprocessor">.Union</span>(uriParts<span class="preprocessor">.Take</span>(uriParts<span class="preprocessor">.Count</span>() - <span class="number">1</span>))<span class="comment">;</span>
    }

    var postPath = Path<span class="preprocessor">.Combine</span>(Settings<span class="preprocessor">.OutputPath</span>, item<span class="preprocessor">.Published</span><span class="preprocessor">.ToString</span>(<span class="string">"yyyy-MM-dd"</span>) + <span class="string">"-"</span> + uriParts<span class="preprocessor">.Last</span>()) + <span class="string">".html.md"</span><span class="comment">;</span>
    if (!File<span class="preprocessor">.Exists</span>(postPath))
        File<span class="preprocessor">.CreateText</span>(postPath)<span class="preprocessor">.Close</span>()<span class="comment">;</span>

<p>Ok, that&#39;ll do nicely, I&#39;ve extracted my tags, cleaned up my URIs, so <code>/flight-mode/indexeddb</code> becomes <code>/posts/2013-05-27-indexeddb.html</code> for example, and I&#39;ve built up a meta-data header which contains all the information that I found to be important (check out the <a href="http://docpad.org/docs/meta-data">DocPad documentation</a> to get a better idea of what meta-data is available and for what purpose).</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s time to get it into Git, and more importantly, get it into Git with the right author date. Remember how I said there are two dates which a commit has, well I&#39;m only going to concern myself with the <code>author date</code>, since that was when the revision was created, but the date it when into the repository isn&#39;t particularly important, for all it matters it could have been in another repository before now (which abstractly speaking it was).</p>
<p>Turns out that this is actually <strong>really</strong> easy to do! In fact LibGit2Sharp exposes the API to do just that as part of the commit API!</p>
<pre class="highlighted"><code class="avrasm">    var commitMessage = string<span class="preprocessor">.IsNullOrEmpty</span>(item<span class="preprocessor">.Reason</span>) ? <span class="string">"I should have given a reason"</span> : item<span class="preprocessor">.Reason</span><span class="comment">;</span>
    repo<span class="preprocessor">.Index</span><span class="preprocessor">.Stage</span>(<span class="string">"*"</span>)<span class="comment">;</span>
    repo<span class="preprocessor">.Commit</span>(commitMessage, new Signature(<span class="string">"Aaron Powell"</span>, <span class="string">"me@aaron-powell.com"</span>, (DateTime) item<span class="preprocessor">.Date</span>))<span class="comment">;</span></code></pre>
<p>First things first I&#39;ve created a commit message based off of the revision reason in FunnelWeb, next I&#39;ll stage all changes in the repository (this is just so I can be lazy and not worry about the file name :P) and lastly commit the stage providing an author signature <em>which contains the author date as an argument</em>.</p>
<p>I was honestly shocked at just how easy that process turned out to be!</p>
<p>So now when we execute the code it&#39;ll build up a nice Git repository for us.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>And that&#39;s it, with only 100 lines of code (which contains a rather large SQL statement too) I was able to pull all the data out from FunnelWeb and then push each post revision as a separate Git commit.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll find the full code for my migrator <a href="https://github.com/aaronpowell/aaronpowell.github.io/tree/master/_migrator">in my sites repository</a>.</p>
<p>One final note though, I did have the following two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The migrator didn&#39;t like being run in the same repository as I was opening with LibGit2Sharp, I think the problem was related to ScriptCS locking the <code>/bin</code> folder which Git then didn&#39;t have any access to and it&#39;d crash. I didn&#39;t look too deeply into this (C ain&#39;t my forte these days) and it was easily solved by having the migrator source in a separate location (and it also meant I didn&#39;t accidentally commit my real connection string)</li>
<li>LibGit2Sharp didn&#39;t seem to like it when I wasn&#39;t in the <code>master</code> branch. I initially tried to use a separate branch to create all the commits that I&#39;d then review and rebase into master, but whenever I did this it would create a new repository in the destination folder so I ended up with nested Git repositories. Again I didn&#39;t delve into the underlying reason, I left it for Brendan to entertain himself with, instead I just did it in master and deleted my clone the few times I stuffed up :P</li>
</ul>
