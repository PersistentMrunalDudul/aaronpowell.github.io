Hi, my name's Aaron Powell and I'm a [Cloud Developer Advocate (CDA) at Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/index.html). My area of specialty is front-end web development, focusing on architecture around SPA and other UI-heavy web applications.

I'm also a passionate Open Source developer, with one of my main pet projects being [Chauffeur](https://github.com/aaronpowell/chauffeur) an automation tool for the [Umbraco CMS](http://umbraco.com).

I do quite a bit of community work and public speaking, you'll often find me at user groups in Sydney such as [ALT.NET Sydney](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Sydney-Alt-Net/), presenting at conferences (see below for my upcoming speaking engagements) or organising the [DDD Sydney](http://dddsydney.com.au) conference.
