                            <p>In case you&#39;ve been living under a rock for the last few months you should have heard about <a href="http://nuget.codeplex.com">NuGet</a>, and if you have been here&#39;s the abridged version.</p>
<p>NuGet is a package manager for .NET projects. Basically think Ruby Gems, NPM for Node.js, etc and you&#39;ll come up with NuGet for .NET.</p>
<p>NuGet isn&#39;t the first attempt at a unified package management system, <a href="http://www.openwrap.org/">OpenWrap</a> was here first, but it didn&#39;t seem to have the reach that NuGet seems to have (yes this could be because you&#39;ve got the official Microsoft stamp of awesome, lots more <em>Microsoft shills</em> blogging about it, etc), but that shouldn&#39;t be important, what&#39;s more important is there is actually a package management story for .NET now.</p>
<h2>How does NuGet work though?</h2>
<p>Well NuGet is made up of two parts, first there is the <a href="http://nuget.org">NuGet Gallery</a> which packages are uploaded, packages can be downloaded, etc. This is data provided to connecting clients using <a href="http://odata.org">OData</a> (which allows cool things like <a href="http://www.aaron-powell.com/nuget/linqpad">querying with LINQPad</a>). You can also create your own NuGet server using the <a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/NuGet.Server">NuGet.Server</a> package.</p>
<p>Consuming NuGet can be done a couple of ways. As mentioned above you can use an OData reader such as LINQPad. You can write your own consumer that uses the <a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/NuGet.Core">NuGet.Core</a> package (which I covered in detail in <a href="http://www.aaron-powell.com/creating-a-nuget-plugin-engine">this post</a>) or you can use the <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/27077b70-9dad-4c64-adcf-c7cf6bc9970c">Visual Studio 2010 tool</a>.</p>
<p>The Visual Studio tool also include a set of Powershell scripts which mean that you can call out to NuGet from Powershell, although I&#39;m not entirely sure how well it&#39;d work outside of Visual Studio as it does seem to use some of the VS API to add references to a project. But the Powershell tools are cool, they allow you to do things like <a href="http://www.aaron-powell.com/nuget/global-install-package">this</a>.</p>
<h2>What makes up a NuGet package</h2>
<p>A NuGet package, or <strong>nupkg</strong> file, it really just a ZIP file with a manifest within it. The <a href="http://nuget.codeplex.com/documentation?title=Nuspec%20Format">nuspec format</a> is documented and can easily be implemented. The way the files are treated has also <a href="http://nuget.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Package%20Conventions">been documented</a> and most of it is based off of conventions. Really the main two you need to know are:</p>
<ul>
<li>/lib files go into the project references</li>
<li>/Content files go into the root of the project (and folder nesting is allowed)</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#39;s also a <a href="http://nuget.codeplex.com/releases">Package Explorer tool available</a> if you want to dig around the internals of existing packages.</p>
<h2>Should you care?</h2>
<p>I think that NuGet is something that is very vital to the .NET ecosystem. The lack of a unified package management system has been the bane of .NET development for a long time. Yes NuGet wasn&#39;t the first, but does that really matter. I don&#39;t care for the arguments that were waged when NuGet first came out. Accept that it&#39;s here to stay and move on.</p>
<p>And with that said I&#39;m of the opinion that <strong>if it&#39;s not on NuGet then it doesn&#39;t exist</strong>. Harsh as this may seem but I&#39;ve got better things to do than:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the latest stable build</li>
<li>Monitor a project for new versions</li>
<li>Update my version when new releases are out </li>
</ul>
<p>Ask any Rubiest if they&#39;d use something that wasn&#39;t a gem and you&#39;ll pretty much always receive a <strong>no</strong>.</p>
<h2>Is NuGet just for Open Source?</h2>
<p>This was a question asked at a developer event recently, and although it seems that most of the projects which are on NuGet are OSS I don&#39;t see why NuGet would be confined to OSS.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think that you could really do anything truly commercial from the official NuGet feed, but I can&#39;t see why you couldn&#39;t have a trial version of a library on there and as part of the install process&#39; T&amp;C&#39;s state that it&#39;s got restrictions.</p>
<h2>NuGet and Mono</h2>
<p>Something that was a topic of discussion last night with Demis was &quot;Does NuGet work on Mono?&quot; and from the quick searching I did it would seem that there isn&#39;t a Mono version of the &quot;Add Library Reference&quot; dialog that the Visual Studio tools provide. From what I read there is some limitations to running NuGet on Mono (and I&#39;m referring to the Mono CLR) due to some CLR 4 features that NuGet uses which aren&#39;t available on Mono yet.</p>
<p>Demis argued that if Microsoft was really serious about NuGet being a way to deliver open source projects to developers then they should be ensuring that it has Mono tooling.</p>
<p>I beg to differ on this point. Microsoft have done (mostly) the right things so far, the <a href="http://nuget.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets">source is available</a>, there are <a href="http://nuget.codeplex.com/documentation">contribution guidelines</a> if you want to fix issues and there is documentation on the package format. This is about as open source as you&#39;re going to find from Microsoft these days and it&#39;s a heck of a lot better than the Microsoft of old, but as for actually building the tools for MonoDevelop, I think that&#39;s something they should stay away from.</p>
<p>If Microsoft was to add the support to MonoDevelop then it could be seen very much as an overbearing effort to push the platform (not that it&#39;s not being pushed hard already :P).</p>
<h2>Want to know more?</h2>
<p>If you&#39;re wanting to know more about NuGet I suggest that you keep an eye on <a href="http://blog.davidebbo.com/">David Ebbo</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/davidfowler/">David Fowler</a>.</p>
