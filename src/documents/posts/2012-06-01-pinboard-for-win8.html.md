With the release of the Windows 8 store today I'm excited to say that you can now download my [Pinboard for Windows 8 application](http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/app/pinboard/3ed0b8d9-544e-4242-aaa6-d836c47dd0d1)!

A few months ago [Tatham](https://twitter.com/#!/tathamoddie) pointed me to a bookmarking service called [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in) which is described as antisocial bookmarking, and is aimed at being a super simple bookmarking service, it's no fuss, no bells-and-whistles, it's just a bookmarking service.

When I first started using Windows 8 I really wanted to be able to interact with my bookmarks, particularly when I was using IE10 Metro. Since IE10 Metro is a plugin-free browsing experience I wouldn't have a plugin like Chrome so how was I going to manage my bookmarks?

Since Windows 8 aims to have seamless integration between different applications I wanted to leverage this, in particular I wanted to use the [Sharing Target](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/05/14/sharing-links-from-ie10-on-windows-8.aspx) capabilities. Also I wanted to be able to quickly find different bookmarks again Windows 8 provides a good way to do [search](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/10/18/designing-search-for-the-start-screen.aspx) that can integrate with your application.

So if you've got a Pinboard account (and if you don't you should switch to using it!) grab my application and get bookmarking :D.
