<p>
So while going through my blogs I came across one about a new mocking framework specifically designed for unit testing within SharePoint. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081207070804/http://blog.typemock.com/2008/11/newisolatorforsharepointtoolforunittest.html" target="_blank">blog can be found here</a>&nbsp;and from their website they have several demos of using Isolator for SharePoint mocking. 
</p>
<p>
I'm interested in having more of a play with it, and Typemock are offering a free license for so: 
</p>
Typemock are offering their new product for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081207070804/http://www.typemock.com/sharepointpage.php?utm_source=sp_bb&amp;utm_medium=blog_4sp&amp;utm_campaign=sp_bb"><u>unit testing SharePoint</u></a> called Isolator For SharePoint, for a special introduction price. it is the only tool that allows you to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081207070804/http://blog.typemock.com/2008/11/newisolatorforsharepointtoolforunittest.html?utm_source=typeblog&amp;utm_medium=sp_bb&amp;utm_campaign=typeblog"><u>unit test SharePoint</u></a> without a SharePoint server.

<p>
The first 50 bloggers who blog this text in their blog and tell us about it, will get a Full Isolator license, Free. for rules and info <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081207070804/http://blog.typemock.com/2008/11/newisolatorforsharepointtoolforunittest.html"><u>click here</u></a>.

But I do wonder about the overall benefit of Isolator. Without playing with it I can't make any conclusions but I've always found mocking can be a dicy subject, particularly if you're mocking something which can have an impact on the underlying operation of the code<br>
And that is a concern about mocking the SharePoint API. 
</p>
<p>
I'm am a fan of RhinoMocks and have played with it and found it really useful when I was stubbing up interfaces, but I never took it to the level of mocking up full API-level components (although I really do want to get around to trying it to get around some of the limits of the Umbraco API!). 
</p>
<p>
I'll try and do some more investigation on Typemock's Isolator for SharePoint and see what I can find. If it really does what they say it does it could make it easier to develop SharePoint API-prototypes without the need for a SharePoint environment.
