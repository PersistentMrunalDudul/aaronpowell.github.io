Docker is a really useful tool in ones toolbox but when you're first trying to get started in understanding its role it can be quite hard, there's so many new terms to learn, different technologies that fit around the edge of the ecosystem and a lot of content focuses on the advanced (and very useful) applications of it.

But what do you do when you're first getting started? I found myself in that situation when I was consulting to a company so I decided to put together a talk that covers everything from the basics up to some common use cases.

I gave this talk last week as part of the [Microsoft Reactor](https://developer.microsoft.com/reactor/?{{<cda>}}) virtual programming and you'll find it online.

There's also a companion workshop that you can follow along with [on my GitHub](https://github.com/aaronpowell/docker-from-scratch). Happy containerising!
