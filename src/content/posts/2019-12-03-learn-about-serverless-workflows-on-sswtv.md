At NDC Sydney I was invited by the [SSW.tv](https://ssw.tv) team to sit down with [Anthony Ison](https://anthonyison.com/) and chat about a topic that I'm really passionate about, using Durable Functions to create workflows.

You can check out the recording on YouTube, and my previous blog posts on the topic through my [`serverless`](/tags/serverless) tag.
