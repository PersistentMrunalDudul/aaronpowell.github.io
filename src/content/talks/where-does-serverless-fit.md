abstract: |
    Serverless, like any new technology, can seem like a magic bullet for projects and before you know it someone is suggesting that you rewrite your whole application as microservices distributed in a Serverless model. But is this really what we should be doing? Do you really have to throw away everything and start again to leverage the value of Serverless?

    Let's take a look at some of the roles that Serverless can play within our existing solutions, from how it can be the backbone of a, event-centric model, to monitoring infrastructure, or offloading computationally expensive operations from our applications main workers.

    In this talk we'll go beyond traditional Serverless cloud offerings and look at the breadth of tools to help us scale our solutions without the dreaded rewrite.

audience:
    - Developers maintaining existing apps
    - People with Serverless experience
    - People wanting to get started with Serverless

notes: |
    Some of the content covered here is from content delivered in Microsoft Ignite The Tour sessions around event-centric systems and using other parts of the Azure Serverless platform like Event Grid and Logic Apps, while other parts will look at scenarios driven from customer engagements.

    While this talk will use Azure as the cloud provider, the patterns covered in it are intended to be generic for any cloud platform.
