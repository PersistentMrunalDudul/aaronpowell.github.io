LINQ to Umbraco is awesome, let's not deny it, but I had a thought of how could I make it even more awesome...

There was a lot of things that I wanted to achieve with LINQ to Umbraco that couldn't be done in the time frame of the Umbraco 4.5 release, and some things which aren't really applicable in the context of the Umbraco core.

So this project will aim to fill in the gaps that LINQ to Umbraco leaves out of the core of Umbraco.
