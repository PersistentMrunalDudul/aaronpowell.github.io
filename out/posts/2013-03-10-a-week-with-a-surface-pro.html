                            <p>So a little a week ago I got myself a Surface Pro and I decided that I&#39;d share my experience with it thus far (because that&#39;s what you do with a new device right? :P).</p>
<p>For the record my current Windows machine is a Sony Vaio Z which is about 2.5 years old and I have an iPad 2, so these were the two devices that my Surface Pro was looking to <em>replace</em>.</p>
<h1>The screen</h1>
<p>First off let&#39;s talk about the screen, it&#39;s the first thing you&#39;ll see after all, and I must say it&#39;s a very nice screen to work with indeed. The Surface Pro is a 1920 x 1080 resolution on a 10.6&quot; panel so it&#39;s a pretty high pixel density packed in there. Sure it&#39;s no retina display but it&#39;s pretty well up there.</p>
<p>When in Metro-mode things fit nicely, IE looks really good on it and the few apps that I have installed/used (mail, calendar, twitter, facebook, etc) do fit in with the design theme nicely. Most importantly they look sharp under the display.</p>
<p>Desktop-mode is a little different. By default the Surface Pro has the font size turned up to 150% meaning that many windows look just plain odd, toolbars don&#39;t fit in properly, consoles look weird, etc. One of the first tasks I undertook on Desktop was to flick it down to 125%. This seems to make everything scale to a much better size while still keeping things large enough to be touch friendly.</p>
<p>The only big worry people have with a touch-enabled screen is fingerprints. Currently I&#39;m looking at the screen while typing the post out and I can honestly say I don&#39;t notice any. When the screen is off and I&#39;m in direct sunlight I&#39;ll notice them but in that regard I&#39;m not really using my screen anyway.</p>
<h1>Interacting with it</h1>
<p>When I bought the Surface Pro I wanted to get a keyboard. Having had an iPad for 18 months now one thing that annoys me about it is that I don&#39;t have a keyboard with it. Sure I could grab my Bluetooth keyboard or get one of the many cases that have one built in but really they don&#39;t seem to fit the ascetics of the device.</p>
<p>So you&#39;ve got two choices for the Surface series, a Touch Cover or a Type Cover. I strongly recommend that before you choose one you do some typing with both and see what you feel most comfortable with. When I was getting the device I went to test both keyboards by firing up Word and having a type around. To me the Type Cover just felt a lot nicer to work with, the Touch Cover lacked the tactile sensation that many years on a computer have trained me to want and I found that the low-profile that the keyboard runs meant I missed keys too often as I didn&#39;t judge the spacing.</p>
<p>The Type Cover reminds me of my Vaio keyboard, it&#39;s got a good tactile response, a good key size and most importantly a good sound as you press the keys!</p>
<p>What I have found about the keyboard is that it can miss keys; I&#39;m not sure if this is something with my device or not but every now and then I seem to have it miss a few keystrokes that I make, meaning you have to go back over what you&#39;re doing. I&#39;d expect this is some driver-level issue that hopefully will clear up as the device matures but since it&#39;s hard to reproduce I can imagine it&#39;ll be a slow fix.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons I wanted a Pro over a RT was the pen support. The Pro comes with a pen and I must say it&#39;s really fantastic to use. So far I haven&#39;t been in enough meetings that I&#39;ve actually had to crack it out but I&#39;ve done some doodling in various apps and it just works as you&#39;d expect it to work. I&#39;ll often find myself using the pen in Desktop mode instead of the trackpad or my finger because of its precision.</p>
<p>And that leads me onto the trackpad in the cover, or more generally, <em>mouse</em> based input. I can probably count the number of times on one hand that I&#39;ve used the trackpad that comes in the cover, simply put I find it redundant (for the record I primarily use the trackpad on my laptop over an external mouse so it&#39;s not an anti-trackpad stance or anything). With the screen as close as it is it&#39;s very easy, and natural, to just reach out and touch it to move around. Even writing this I&#39;ve been touching around the screen to move the cursor back/forth because it&#39;s quicker than the trackpad or arrow keys.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been really surprised at how quickly I&#39;ve adapted to having a touch-enabled device in front of me and how quickly I got use to being about to touch the screen to perform my actions. This has gotten to the point where I now expect all my screens to be touch enabled which has made me feel rather silly when I&#39;ve poked the screens on my work machine or when I spent a good 30 seconds poking my Vaio screen and getting angry that the window wasn&#39;t exiting.</p>
<p>Desktop mode is really the only place that is let down by touch, particularly Visual Studio.</p>
<h1>Coding</h1>
<p>Since I&#39;m a coder it was natural that Visual Studio was going to wind up on here at some point. So far I haven&#39;t done anything really intensive in the form of development using the Surface Pro, more just opening projects and browsing around the source. But Visual Studio really isn&#39;t designed for touch. I&#39;d like to be able to &quot;flick up&quot; and have the source code scroll but alas it&#39;s not to be, instead I find myself fighting with the small scrollbars and often reverting to the pen as it&#39;s much better a finer point interaction.</p>
<p>As I said I haven&#39;t done much in the way of coding on the device so I can&#39;t really comment on the overall performance of it, but I think it&#39;s safe to say that I don&#39;t see this as a replacement for a high-end developer laptop, instead I see this as something I can grab out on the train for a quick bit of coding, especially if I&#39;m focusing on something non-Visual Studio based.</p>
<h1>Metro or Desktop</h1>
<p>I&#39;ve been trying to keep my usage of this device very much in the Metro word, I have my mail setup using the Mail app, calendars are available through Calendar, etc. Generally speaking this is working well for me.</p>
<p>Mail is a bit up-and-down with it&#39;s interactions. I&#39;ve come from an Outlook background and as someone who tries to maintain a &quot;zero inbox&quot; but ultimately found  this was something that fell by the wayside with the Mail client. Part of the reason was it is a bit of a hassle to move mail around into folders and part of it is because it seems less valuable to do so, since the entire mailbox isn&#39;t down it&#39;s easier to have one folder to search rather than rummaging around (but this is more of a general mail organization shift than specific to Windows 8 Mail).</p>
<p>That said I do have Outlook installed as well and generally speaking I have both running. I like Outlook for its familiar but the UI isn&#39;t really touch optimized so it can be a bit clunky. Mail is nicer for touch but the integration with the GAL is really terrible and I can&#39;t for the life of me work out how to add someone as a contact, even if they emailed me first (again where Outlook is much more useful).</p>
<p>IE works fantastically in Metro, the new shell is really slick and the interactions are really nicely designed. So far I haven&#39;t even installed another browser, I&#39;ve found no need (maybe once I start doing some more web dev I&#39;ll switch since <a href="http://www.aaron-powell.com/web-dev/ie10-console-thoughts">I&#39;ve got some opinions on the dev tools</a>). The only real frustrating thing is there&#39;s no plugin support so I can&#39;t get my password manager integrated which makes the workflow of hitting somewhere I need to log into a pain.</p>
<p>For twitter I&#39;ve been trying a variety of clients. Currently I&#39;m using MetroTwit for Win8, I tried Rowi but I really didn&#39;t like it (no replies in snapped, full screen has a really strange use of space and a few other issues).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been trying out a few different RSS readers, found a paid one called <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/app/d03199c9-8e08-469a-bda1-7963099840cc">Feed Reader</a> that has a trial version that seems pretty good.</p>
<p>So mostly I find myself in Metro mode as there&#39;s been very little that I need in common usage to go to desktop. That said if it wasn&#39;t for Snapped mode then it might be a different story. I&#39;ve pretty much always got twitter snapped, ticking away. The screen resolution is more than enough to visible space to have a good browser window/email window/etc and having twitter running there too.</p>
<h1>Overall</h1>
<p>I&#39;ve been using Win8 on my laptop for over 12 months now and had always enjoyed it but now having a touch-enabled device to use it on I&#39;ve really seen it in a whole new light. The Metro UI makes a lot more sense in a touch environment, the platform integration (sharing, search, etc) is so smooth.</p>
<p>The Surface Pro is great device, if you&#39;re looking for something <em>reasonably</em> portable I&#39;d recommend looking at it. It&#39;s a little bit on the heavy side for me to consider it a direct iPad replacement, but compared to even my Vaio Z (which is really light) it&#39;s a much more portable device.</p>
<p>One thing&#39;s for sure, my next developer laptop is going to be touch-enabled, I&#39;m finding it surprisingly advantageous.</p>
