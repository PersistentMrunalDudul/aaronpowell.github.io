    You are embarking on a new project and have decided to give JAMStack a try, after all, a web application really only needs some JavaScript, API's to back it up and Markup to make the pages appear!

    But how do we deploy this into Azure? We want to have a DevOps pipeline, so we'll give GitHub Actions a go. Then we're going to need somewhere to run the API, hosting for the static site, domain, SSL, routing and oh my it's becoming complex!

    Don't fear, we'll go through the steps together, see that we can setup an application with DevOps to deploy with the simplicity of a git push and get you JAM'ing in no time!

audience:
    - People doing JAMStack
    - People curious about JAMStack
    - Web developers

notes: |
    This is a demo-heavy talk where we'll mostly spend time building a web application in VS Code before hooking it up with GitHub Actions and Azure. For the demo app, it can be done with React, Angular, Vue or with a static site generator like Gatsby or VuePress, depending on what will fit the audience.

    I'll be drawing on my experience from how we have run the DDD Sydney stack and my own personal website.
