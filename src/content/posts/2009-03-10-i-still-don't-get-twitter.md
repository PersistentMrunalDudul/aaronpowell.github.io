<p>So Karl posted today (well, tomorrow at 2.29am or something, yeah <strong>my</strong> blog isn't the only one who's dates are freaky!) asking <a href="http://www.karlkopp.com/blog/2009/3/10/what-value-does-twitter-deliver" target="_blank">what value Twitter adds</a>.</p>
<p>As I <a href="{{<ref "/posts/2009-01-25-twitterific.md">}}" target="_blank" title="Twitterific">recently posted</a> I have a twitter account and I don't really get the point either.</p>
<p>But I must confess, I'm getting more into it, well, into it but still not getting its point.</p>
<p>Originally when I got onto as I was trying to get a hold of Niels, he was away from his email at the time and I knew he was still checking that :P</p>
<p>Now I do use it a bit more, mainly I use it still to follow Umbraco stuff, but I also follow some others. I started following <a href="http://twitter.com/elijahmanor" target="_blank">Elijah Manor</a> who seems to do nothing but find other interesting blogs on the topic of AJAX, jQuery, etc. I've had a lot of interesting stuff come across his feed.</p>
<p>I also started following <a href="http://twitter.com/paulstovell" target="_blank">Paul Stovell</a> since his blog went down and he's tool <span>lazy</span>busy to fix it.</p>
<p>I <strong>definately</strong> don't get the point of if for the <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/4/23/" target="_blank">I'm Pooping</a> tweets :P</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interesting side-note, my 4th largest source of traffic to my blog is Twitter!</p>
