<p>
Well again my MBP is back to the repairer, I've been having intermitent issues with the keyboard and mouse since it last was repaired (on an unrelated matter) and finally I'd had enough.

<p>
I took it down to the local Mac dealer and handed it over, to be told I'd be without it for around 10 days :(
</p>
<p>
It's going to be a long 10 days, that's for sure...
