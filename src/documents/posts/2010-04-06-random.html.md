## Useful Tools ##

### Developer Tools ###

* [LinqPad][1]
 * Best way to test C# or VB.NET without having to create a console application
* [Notepad++][2]
 * My choice for a Notepad replacement. Syntax highlighting in just about every language
* [RedGate's Reflector][3]
 * If you're a .NET dev and don't have this installed get out of my framework
* [Expresso][4]
 * By far my favorite Regular Expression builder and tester
* [WinMerge][5]
 * If you're using SVN, or just need to be able to diff and merge files or folders this is what you want
