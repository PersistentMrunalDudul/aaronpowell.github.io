A few years ago [Tatham Oddie](https://tath.am/) and I launched a little website
for testing HTTP responses called [httpstat.us](https://httpstat.us).

With websites being encouraged to move to HTTPS-first (like how
[Google is pushing for it](https://www.troyhunt.com/life-is-about-to-get-harder-for-websites-without-https/))
and the cost-point of HTTPS no longer an issue thanks to [Lets Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
I finally got around to enabling HTTPS on there.

Now you can test status codes from secured sites without mixed-mode warnings.
