<p>Ok, I'm going to go on a bit of a rant here.</p>
<p>I'm a Mac user, have been for nearly 2 years now and I think buying a Mac was one of the smartest moves I made as a Microsoft developer; I can run virtual machines for everything I do, easily swapping between different OSes. I currently have XP, Vista and Win7 all on my Mac so I can easily test IE6 -&gt; IE8 without any hacks.</p>
<p>But Apple can <em>really</em>&nbsp;piss me off some times. This week has seen WWDC going on in the US and by-and-large I've been underwhelmed by it, almost to the point where I'm just plain annoyed at Apple and their marketing attitude.</p>
<p>And today I read an article which really got me angry, <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/06/12safari.html" target="_blank">Apple announced that Safari 4 has had 11 million downloads</a>. Now if you read that article you'd think that Safari has become the most dominate browser on the planet. I mean, Safari has always been a bit-player running along behind the likes of IE and Firefox like the annoying yappy little dog trying to be one of the big fellows.<br />You know what, nothing has changed.</p>
<p>What Apple have <em>failed</em>&nbsp;to mention in their announcement is that Safari 4 is pushed out to <strong>all</strong>&nbsp;OS X 10.5 (and 10.6 beta users I guess) as a system update, and at that, a pre-selected system update.<br />So I've installed Safari 4, but I use it maybe 1% of my browsing time (I'm one of those really horrible people who uses an even more obscure browser, <a href="http://www.opera.com" target="_blank">Opera</a> :P), but hey, I'm part of the 11 million strong <em>loyal Safari fan-base</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure Microsoft probably has IE8 listed as an update for Vista (work domain policy just auto-updates for me, I don't ever look at them) but I remember when IE7 was released for XP it wasn't selected-by-default as an install, it was an optional. Sure Safari 4 was an optional upgrade, but when something is optional by opt-out rather than optional by opt-in you find more people will not bother to opt-out.</p>
<p>Using Apple's logic we can say that 20 million people think Kevin Rudd is a good prime minister. After all, the population of Australia is 20 million, he's the PM and to the best of my knowledge there isn't any kind of&nbsp;coup d'&eacute;tat planned to remove him from power.</p>
<p>As the great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_Simpson" target="_blank">Homer Simpson</a> said&nbsp;"People can come up with statistics to prove anything. 14% of people know that".</p>
<p>Oh, and to close off, this post was written in Safari 4 on OS X ;).</p>
