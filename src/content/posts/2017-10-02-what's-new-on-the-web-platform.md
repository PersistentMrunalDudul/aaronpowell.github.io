I recently blogged [about my experience at MS Edge Web Summit]({{< ref "posts/2017-09-15-msedge-summit-2017.md" >}}). On the back of this I was invited to speak at [ALT.NET Sydney](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Sydney-Alt-Net/) to share some of the things I'd learnt about. I covered off three topics, the [Payment Request API](http://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/), [Sonar](https://sonarwhal.com/) and some new features in F12.

For the Payment Request API I created some demos:

1. [A basic demo]({{< ref "demos/payment-request/demo1.md" >}})
1. [A demo using multiple payment methods]({{< ref "demos/payment-request/demo2.md" >}})
1. [Requesting shipping address]({{< ref "demos/payment-request/demo3.md" >}})
1. [Dynamic shipping options]({{< ref "demos/payment-request/demo4.md" >}})
1. ["Lazy loading" shipping options]({{< ref "demos/payment-request/demo4.md" >}})

_Note: These demos are purely client side and don't submit card details or anything, you can see the code for each page by following the commit link in their footers._

If you want to learn what the Payment Request API is about [check out this article](https://medium.com/dev-channel/addressing-common-misconceptions-about-the-payment-request-api-4d0db51dae75).

I also cover off Sonar, which is a linting tool that's great for ensuring you're website is running as best as it can be (yep, I haven't got it integrated into my blog yet, one day :stuck_out_tongue:).

The final topic was what's new in F12 for Edge 16, but I was really pressed for time by then, so you'll get more out of [Jacob Rossi's](https://twitter.com/jacobrossi) [MS Edge Web Summit talk](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/WebPlatformSummit/Microsoft-Edge-Web-Summit-2017/ES10).

If you want to watch my talk it's up on YouTube.
