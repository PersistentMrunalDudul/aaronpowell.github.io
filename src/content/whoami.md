Hi, my name's Aaron Powell and I'm a Regional Cloud Developer Advocate (CDA) at Microsoft. Prior to that I worked at [Readify](https://readify.net) in a number of different roles. My area of specialty is front-end web development, focusing on architecture around SPA and other UI-heavy web applications. My background is ASP.NET as a server technology but I've expanded into Node.js, a bit of Go, but ultimately trying to be a polyglot.

I'm also a passionate Open Source developer, with one of my main pet projects being [Chauffeur](https://github.com/aaronpowell/chauffeur) an automation tool for the [Umbraco CMS](http://umbraco.com).

I do quite a bit of community work and public speaking, you'll often find me at user groups in Sydney such as [ALT.NET Sydney](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Sydney-Alt-Net/), presenting at conferences or organising the [DDD Sydney](http://dddsydney.com.au) conference.

Since 2011 I've been awarded a [Microsoft MVP (Front-end Web Development)](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/4032620) award for my contributions to the web development community.

## Employment History

### January 2019 - Present - [Microsoft](https://careers.microsoft.com)

#### January 2019 - Present

**Regional [Cloud Developer Advocate (CDA)](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/index.html)**

I work with developer communities to grow, achieve more and be more awesome.

### September 2010 - December 2018 - [Readify](https://readify.net)

#### September 2017 - December 2018

**Technical Pre-sales Consultant**

Expanding on the work on Technical Pre-Sales I was undertaking as a Principal Consultant I moved into a dedicated Technical Pre-Sales role. The primary focus of this role is:

- Working with the sales team to qualify opportunities
- Improving the technical skills of the sales team
- Develop tools and practices to effectively respond to proposals
- Create material that can be used by the sales team that speaks to the services Readify can deliver

#### August 2016 - August 2017

**Principal Consultant**

This was the end goal of a 6 year journey I'd taken within Readify, that I [blogged about]({{< ref "/posts/2016-08-29-SC-to-PC.md" >}}). As a Principal Consultant I:

- Worked on Pre-Sales activities such as tender responses and lead qualification
- Consulted to a multinational FinTech company with producing a front-end web architecture based on React
- Consulted to a multinational services company to provide enterprise architecture services, process guidance and delivery capacity on a a React web portal and a React Native iOS/Android application
- People management involving career mentoring, conflict management and general coaching
- Working with the heads of the organisation on the strategic direction of Readify
- Collaborating with the other Readify Principal Consultants

#### September 2010 - August 2016

Over my first 5 years at Readify I worked my way from the role of Senior Developer to Lead Consultant. During this time I worked across a variety of industries from banking to mining and many technologies. Some highlights are:

- Working on a new web portal for one of the big 4 banks in Australia, using a combination of ASP.NET MVC and a custom JavaScript UI framework
- Team lead for a web reporting platform for IoT devices in the mining industry, using a combination of ASP.NET WebAPI2, React, MongoDB and Azure PaaS
- Leading a number of CMS builds using Umbraco across government, health care and entertainment

### August 2009 - August 2010 - The FARM Digital

**Senior Developer**

I joined The FARM Digital to focus on delivering Umbraco-centric websites which aligned with the open source work I was doing at the time. I worked closely with the technical director who was also a contributor to Umbraco (and then joined them as a full time employee, eventually CTO) on how we optimised our repeatability of delivery (CI/CD, modularisation of the solutions, standard components, etc.).

### August 2005 - August 2009 - WDG/Next Digital

**Junior Developer/Senior Developer/Senior Architect**

I joined WDG (later renamed Next Digital) as a Junior Developer out of university. Over my 4 years I worked across a number of CMS-centric projects, moving up to Senior Developer and eventually Senior Architect working on a custom CRM for a Victorian government department.

## Open Source Work

I published my first Open Source project, [Umbraco Interaction Layer](https://github.com/aaronpowell/umbraco-interaction-layer), in 2008, which provided a LINQ interface to Umbraco. Through this I was invited to join the [Umbraco CMS](https://github.com/umbraco/umbraco-cms) Open Source project where I developed a more fully-featured [LINQ provider for Umbraco](https://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2010-04-07-linq-to-umbraco-overview/) as well as being invited to their annual conference in 2009, CodeGarden, in Copenhagen.

Since then I've published a lot of my code to [GitHub](https://github.com/aaronpowell). Some of my highlight projects are:

- [Chauffeur](https://github.com/aaronpowell/chauffeur)
  - This is a tool to automate Umbraco deployments in a CI/CD process
  - It works in a similar vain to SQL migration tools by tracking steps that have previously been run and avoiding re-running them
  - It also provides a REPL style interface to interacting/inspecting Umbraco instances
- [LINQ in JavaScript](https://github.com/aaronpowell/linq-in-javascript)
  - An implementation of LINQ using JavaScript generators to delay execution of collection queries
- [db.js](https://github.com/aaronpowell/db.js)
  - A wrapper around IndexedDB to introduce a Promise interface to IndexedDB
  - A fluent query API for IndexedDB databases
- [PSNVM](https://github.com/aaronpowell/ps-nvmw)
  - A Node.js version manager written in PowerShell

## Public Speaking

I've spoke at a number of conferences across Australia, New Zealand, Europe and America. Some of my speaking highlights include:

- Speaking at every [DDD Melbourne](http://dddmelbourne.com) except 2015 (due to the birth of my son) since it started in 2010
- Speaking at 4 CodeGarden conferences
- Speaking at NDC Sydney 2016 ([Beyond `console.log`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw96iCXM9I8&index=61&list=PL03Lrmd9CiGefSKKePkvtkKkflApUK1qD)), NDC London 2017 ([The beauty of stupid ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJOGeyQIbpc&index=17&list=PL03Lrmd9CiGf2iIh4x8HM4iKmi6PhCe96) and [Redux, beyond React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbyQynY7zDw&index=94&list=PL03Lrmd9CiGf2iIh4x8HM4iKmi6PhCe96)) and NDC Sydney 2017
- Speaking at multiple TechEd's across Australia and New Zealand

I also speak quite frequently at User Groups in Sydney, some of which [are available online](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo-HK2IT4q4g696dKbKg3l2wnr1GkXzyb).

### DDD Sydney

## Pluralsight

I've been a [Pluralsight Author](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/aaron-powell) since 2012 with a variety of courses across a number of different technologies and platforms, from JavaScript to Umbraco.
