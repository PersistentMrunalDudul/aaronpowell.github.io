[Chauffeur](https://github.com/aaronpowell/chauffeur) is one of my pet projects and is something that I think is really quite useful when it comes to working with Umbraco in a CI/CD situation.

Earlier this month I was given the opportunity to speak at the [Sydney Umbraco UG](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Sydney-Umbraco-Meetup/) and show off Chauffeur.

I also recorded the presentation for anyone who's interested in learning more about Chauffeur and seeing it in action. I cover off the role of Chauffeur, how to get started with it and finally its extensibility model. Check out the video on YouTube and if you'd like to know more about Chauffeur or understand how better to integrate it into your workflow I'm happy to have a chat.
