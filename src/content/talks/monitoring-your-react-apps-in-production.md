title: Monitor your React applications in production
hidden: true
tags: ["javascript", "web", "react", "azure"]
duration: 45 minutes
abstract: |
    Guess what? Your applications have bugs in them. The bugs may result from bad data, unexpected user input, or the reliability of the NBN. The good news is that when these run time issues occur your application can handle them gracefully and notify you and your team!

    You'll learn in this session how you can add sophisticated monitoring to your app that leverages React features such as Hooks, Error Boundaries and component design.

audience:
    - Web Developers
    - React Developers
    - Full Stack Developers
    - Ops Engineers

notes: |
    This talk has grown out of a blog series that I created [on the topic](/posts/2019-10-04-implementing-monitoring-in-react-using-appinsights) and will cover off a number of different aspects of monitoring a React application, from user tracking to error monitoring.

    While the talk is designed around React web applications much of the content will be relevant to React Native applications.
