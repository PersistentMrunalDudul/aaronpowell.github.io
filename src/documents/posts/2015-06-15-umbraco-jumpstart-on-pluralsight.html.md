**TL;DR** My latest [Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com/) course, [Umbraco Jumpstart](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/umbraco-jumpstart) is up.

Over the last few months I've been working on a new Pluralsight course, [Umbraco Jumpstart](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/umbraco-jumpstart), today it finally got published and I couldn't be happier.

This is very much a beginner course, my aim was to help people who have either never seen Umbraco before or haven't had a chance to play with it yet take their first steps into Umbraco. Basically I want to ge a whole new generation of people working with Umbraco. That does mean that if you're already using Umbraco it might be a little bit too basic for you, but now is where you can chime in.

With this course out I want to look at what comes next, what topics do you want to see covered on Pluralsight in the Umbraco space as I really want to start getting the library built up. So my fellow Umbracians, what would you like me to start covering?
