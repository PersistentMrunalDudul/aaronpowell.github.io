title: Getting SAFE with F#

tags: ["fsharp", "dotnet", "webdev", "live-coding"]
duration: 45 mintues
abstract: |
  Being able to ‘write once, run everywhere’ is the dream of many platforms and the F# SAFE stack is one step closer to making that a reality for application developers.

  Starting with FAKE as a DSL for creating build scripts, moving into Saturn as an MVC application layer and a UI with Fable in the browser, the possibility of F# all the way down is a reality.

  In a former life, Aaron was a Front-End Web Dev MVP and has a passion for the browser. 

  We’ll explore what it’s like to create a real work application with F#, starting by building a codebase before moving into a CI/CD pipeline using Azure Pipelines. We'll then deploy it as an API to an Azure AppService and finally create a Single Page Application running as a static site. By the end of this talk, you’ll see that an end to end full stack F# is truly a reality!

audience:
  - .NET Devs
  - F# devs
  - Web devs

notes: |
  This is similar to the talk of the same name, but presented solo and without the mobile component.

  We'll be covering Fable (https://fable.io/), Saturn (https://saturnframework.org/), SAFE (https://safe-stack.github.io/), FAKE (https://fake.build/) and several Azure services (Pipelines, Storage and AppServices).
