Today I released a little website, [http://javascriptquiz.com][1], which was inspired by [http://cssquiz.com][2].

Basically it's a site which I'll put out JavaScript questions for people to tackle. If you have any ideas for questions which you'd like to see put out to the community feel free to drop me an email (I'm sure if you're cluey you can find it on this site :P).
