<p>I thought today was an apt time to post another update on LINQ to Umbrace, as one month from today I'll be in Copenhagen Denmark preparing for the Umbraco retreat and then Code Garden '09.</p>
<p>So what's the status? Anyone who follows the check-ins on Umbraco in Codeplex will have noticed that I haven't really done a lot lately.<br />I <em>am</em>&nbsp;still working on it but I've not recently had as much time as I would have liked.</p>
<p>A lot of the code has been coming together nicely, the provider model is working very well and the unit testability of the codebase is meeting its design.</p>
<p>Basically I am on track to have a good working prototype to demo at Code Garden this year!</p>
<p>So all you lucky people who will be attending should expect a nice bit of a show :)&nbsp;</p>
