So a new decade is upon us and with 2009 wrapped up it's time to look retrospectively at the year that was.

2009 was the biggest year professionally that I've had, the whole year has been filled with new adventures into the development world.

At the start of the year I announced my first Open Source project, the Umbraco Interaction Layer (UIL) was ceasing development as I'd joined the Umbraco core development team.

I had lot of fun delving into LINQ in greater depths, like commenting on the [difference between LINQ query syntax vs LINQ methods syntax][1], then having more fun by writing a [JavaScript LINQ implementation][2].

Next I took up a pleasure of mine, doing bizar coding, first with [recursive anonymous self executing functions in JavaScript][3] and then I wrote [it in .NET too][4]!

Also I was luck enough to get invited to Code Garden 09 in Copenhagen, which was an awesome trip and a great chance to meet other Umbracians from around the world. One of the outcomes was the first AUSPAC webinar (with the 2nd coming in the new year).
Also coming out of my Denmark trip was a new employment opportunity which saw me moving from my home town of Melbourne to Sydney to join Shannon at TheFARM.

Umbraco managed to get out Umbraco 4.1 Beta 1 on time, although the scheduled has since been revised (there will be more information coming shortly on this).
And to celebrate the occasion I released a set of [videos on using LINQ to Umbraco][5].

Then to finish the year off I released a new Open Source project, [ASP.NET Web Forms Model-View-Presenter Contrib][6].

What a busy year! Hopefully 2010 can prove to be just as exciting :D
