## About Me ##

Hi, my name's Aaron Powell and I'm an alcoholic. Or wait, is this the right forum to be talking about that? Hmm...

Actually I'm a 20-something year old software developer living in Sydney Australia. My main development platform is ASP.NET, both Web Forms and MVC.

I've been developing professionally since 2005 where I started at [Next Digital][1] in Melbourne. I then since moved to Sydney to take up a position at [TheFARM Digital][2]. I have since moved to [Readify][3], who I am working for in the position of as a Senior Developer.

Throughout my few years as a professional developer I've been spread across a number of CMS (Content Management System) platforms, from OpenText (formerly RedDot CMS), Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007 and most prominently [Umbraco][4].

I've been on the Umbraco core team since 2009 when I was asked to join so I could produce LINQ to Umbraco, for the 4.5 release. Since then I've help out on a number of new features including an out-of-the-box spell checker, consolidating the API's and improving the search capabilities with Umbraco Examine. With the upcoming Umbraco 4.6 (Juno) release I have been helping out improving the extensibility capabilities [through Razor][5], or through [developing your own macro engine][6].
I'm very passionate about Umbraco and when time permits I run the AUSPAC Umbraco user group sessions. 

In 2009 I was lucky enough to attend the Umbraco CodeGarden09 conference where I gave a short talk on LINQ to Umbraco, and working with the Umbraco API in general. In 2010 I attended [CodeGarden10][7], this this time I [spoke on testable Umbraco development][8] via [WebForms MVP][9]. I also demoed LINQ to Umbraco during the keynote and engaged in a fun-filled debate about the merits of LINQ vs XSLT.

Additionally we started work on the upcoming Umbraco 5 project and presented with [Alex Norcliffe][10] about what Umbraco 5 will bring and how we're going about the development of it. Since then I have been active in the development of both the Umbraco 5 framework (the underlying API) and the front end, which is being developed in ASP.Net MVC3.

In addition to my contributions to the Umbraco project I also contribute to several other open source projects:

* [Examine][11]
* [Client Dependency][12]
* [ASP.NET WebForms MVP Contrib][13]
* [FunnelWeblog][14]

This website ([http://aaron-powell.com][15]) is my primary blog, but in addition I also blog on the open-source website, [FarmCode.org][16]. Here you'll get an insight into some of the open-source project I collaborate on.

## Open Conference Protocol

On the 16th of October 2010 I participated in the Amped Web hack-day in a team with [Tatham Oddie][17] and [Brendan Foster][18] to produce the [Open Conference Protocol][19]. Full information can be found at the website.

## Community Involvement ##

As mentioned I contribute to several different open-source projects and community involvement is something I'm quite passionate about. This year I attended [DDD Melbourne][20] where I gave a [presentation on Umbraco][21] and then assisted [Lewis Benge][22] with the organisation and running of the [DDD Sydney][23] conference in July.

I've also run several [Umbraco webinar][24] sessions as well as assisting in the organisation of the Umbraco 5th birthday celebrations in Australia and the [Sydney Umbraco user group session][25].

## About this site ##

This would be about version 7 of www.aaron-powell.com, and it's the first for quite a while that I haven't used Umbraco as the blogging engine.

I was looking to move into using a MVC-based blogging engine for quite some time now, but the problem was that I don't really have the time to work on it. Luckily the work was done for me!

Brisbane developer and friend [Paul Stovell][26] created a blog engine which I really liked the look of called PaulPad (you can see more information in his [Behind PaulStovell.com][27] post), so I downloaded the source off his SVN server and got playing.

I wanted to do more work with MVC2 though, and since PaulPad is only MVC1 I set about upgrading it, I also upgraded it to the latest version of [Autofac][28] (which gave me [no ends of grief!][29]), but after about a week of playing I finally got it working again. People have asked me what I moved away from Umbraco as a blogging platform, and I have answered that question in [this article][31].
