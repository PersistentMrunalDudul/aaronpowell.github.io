<p>So let&#39;s have a look at how you can do that, and how you can make some very interesting JavaScript objects that are self replicating. We&#39;ll build on the knowledge of using <code>bind</code> and <code>apply</code> from the last two posts.</p>

                            <p>I&#39;ve been recently going through some extending of a jQuery UI widget which a colleague had written when I came across quite a number of statements that were using the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/">proxy</a> method from jQuery.</p>
<p>For anyone who&#39;s not familiar with the <code>proxy</code> method is allows you to take a function and specify a context (the <code>this</code> value) so when you pass it around for execution you always know what you&#39;re going to have as the context.</p>
<p>The method has been around for a while and it did serve a good purpose but these days its usefulness is becoming limited and I&#39;m going to look at a few reasons as to why you shouldn&#39;t be using it.</p>
<h1>Understand this</h1>
<p>The most common reason I see that people will use <code>proxy</code> is because they don&#39;t understand how <code>this</code> works in JavaScript. While there are dozens of articles through your favourite search engine explaining <code>this</code> (<a href="http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/30/understanding-javascripts-this/">here&#39;s a good start</a>) I&#39;ll do my best to give a quick overview.</p>
<p>When people come from C# they already have a notion of <code>this</code> and what it represents, unfortunately this is a broken assumption when moving to JavaScript. In C# <code>this</code> represents the current class which you&#39;re working within but since JavaScript <em>isn&#39;t</em> a classical language there isn&#39;t the concept of a <em>class</em> so you couldn&#39;t really associate it to one could you?</p>
<p>Instead <code>this</code> represents the context for which a function is executed for and different kinds of execution result in different contexts. Here&#39;s a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invoking a function from an object will set the context to the owner object</li>
<li>Invoking a function literal will set the context to the global object (<code>window</code> in a browser)</li>
<li>Invoking a function with apply/ call allows it to be controlled</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is why a lot of people get utterly confused with <code>this</code> in JavaScript.</p>
<p>But what does this have to do with the <code>$.proxy</code> method? As I said one of the most common reasons I see people using it is because they want to be able to access members of a particular object within a callback (such as a function called from an AJAX success). Because they are aware that in their outer function they can go <code>this.foo</code> they expect it to be available within the callback (after all isn&#39;t the callback in the same class?) but it will fail so they use <code>$.proxy</code> to ensure that they can access the member(s) they require.</p>
<p>So why is it a poor choice in this scenario? Well the reason is  that you can solve the problem in a much simpler fashion, by understanding JavaScript closures. You can draw a lot of similarities between JavaScript closures and C# closures, but the simplest explanation is that a variable with be within scope until all functions that require is have been descoped. But with the case of <code>this</code>, since it changes between function scopes the <code>var that = this</code> pattern emerged in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s have a look at some code:</p>
<pre class="highlighted"><code class="actionscript"><span class="keyword">var</span> foo = {
    makeRequest: <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="params">()</span> {</span>
        $.<span class="keyword">get</span>(<span class="string">'/foo'</span>, $.proxy(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="params">(result)</span> {</span>
                <span class="keyword">this</span>.update(result);
            }, <span class="keyword">this</span>)
        );
    },

    update: <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="params">(data)</span> {</span> <span class="comment">/* ... */</span> }
};

<span class="comment">//somewhere later in the code</span>
foo.makeRequest();</code></pre>
<p>Here we&#39;re using the <code>proxy</code> method to make it possible to access the <code>update</code> method, since when we called the <code>makeRequest</code> method its <code>this</code> is a reference to <code>foo</code> (we&#39;re assuming that the assignment of <code>foo</code> is out of scope for the <code>makeRequest</code> method). So let&#39;s update it to use variable closures:</p>
<pre class="highlighted"><code class="actionscript"><span class="keyword">var</span> foo = {
    makeRequest: <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="params">()</span> {</span>
        <span class="keyword">var</span> that = <span class="keyword">this</span>;
        $.<span class="keyword">get</span>(<span class="string">'/foo'</span>,<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="params">(result)</span> {</span>
            that.update(result);
        });
    },

    update: <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="params">(data)</span> {</span> <span class="comment">/* ... */</span> }
};

foo.makeRequest();</code></pre>
<p>The difference here is that I&#39;m assigning the value of <code>this</code> to a variable before the callback is created and inside the callback I refer back to the variable.</p>
<p>So why is this better than using <code>proxy</code>? The primary reason is readability, if you look at the first snippet you&#39;re intention is obscured by the use of <code>proxy</code> to change the scope. When someone who understands JavaScript comes to that snippet they have to know what the use of <code>proxy</code> is and why the <code>this</code> context needs to be controlled. With the second snippet it&#39;s clearer to see that you want to call the <code>update</code> method on the same object which <code>makeRequest</code> was invoked from.</p>
<h1>Use built-in methods</h1>
<p>An often missed note of JavaScript (well ECMAScript really) is that the functionality that is provided by <code>proxy</code> (and the similar methods in the other libraries) is built into the language, through the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind">bind</a> method. The <code>bind</code> method was added as part of ECMAScript 5 and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creates a new function that, when called, itself calls this function in the context of the provided this value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function was called.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm that sounds pretty much like what you get from the <code>proxy</code> method yet it&#39;s built into the language.</p>
<p>This means that you can (potentially) get a performance boost (<a href="http://jsperf.com/bind-vs-jquery-proxy">check it out on JSPerf</a>) by using a native browser API rather than the wrapper. Also at the time of writing jQuery (1.7.1) doesn&#39;t use the native browser method it does the code itself.</p>
<p>Performance aside the main difference between the jQuery implementation and the ECMASCript 5 specification is the jQuery <code>proxy</code> method <em>does not throw a type error if the first argument is not a function</em> which the <a href="http://es5.github.com/#x15.3.4.5">spec states</a> <code>bind</code> will do. So although they are named differently they are providing the same functionality except for a critical check.</p>
<p>The take away from this point is that it&#39;s built into the language so using it makes a lot of sense and when you&#39;re in browsers that don&#39;t support it it&#39;s easy to polyfil the missing API (the mdn docs include the polyfil).</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>That wraps up my &quot;rant&quot; against using the <code>proxy</code> method in jQuery. The goal of this article was to teach you a bit more about the JavaScript language and that things people commonly try and work around have simpler solutions.</p>
<p>By understanding language concepts such as <code>this</code> and closures you can avoid manipulating scope.</p>
<p>By knowing what&#39;s new in the language you can use built-in APIs and make faster and more portable code.</p>
