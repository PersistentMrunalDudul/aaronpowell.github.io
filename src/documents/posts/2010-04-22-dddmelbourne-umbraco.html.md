A few weeks ago I was noticing a lot of tweets from the people I follow about an upcoming event in Melbourne called [Developer Developer Developer][1]. Interested I delved into it and found that I really liked what they had to offer. It's a free conference on the Microsoft stack which is community driven, meaning that anyone can propose a topic and the community would vote for what they wanted to see.

So I decided to chuck my hat into the ring and propose a session, and to my horror, I mean surprise, I've been accepted!

Well I've booked a flight, still trying to work out where I'm staying and will be around on Friday night in Melbourne if anyone is up for a pre-conference meet and drink.

Don't forget the [NerdDinner][2] on Saturday night too.

### Secrets of an Umbraco Ninja

This is the session I'll be presenting at DDD Melbourne. I'll be looking at how you can use Umbraco beyond traditional content management. I'll be looking at integration with Flash and Silverlight for rich content, how you can get the most out of performance with Examine and dealing with unpublished content.

After the session I'll be updating this article with any resources for you to download.

See you there!
