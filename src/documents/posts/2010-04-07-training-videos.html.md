In an effort to get everyone up to speed with LINQ to Umbraco I have put together a series of videos. This series looks at how you can use LINQ to Umbraco to create a simple blog engine.

## Session 1 ##

**[Getting Stardted][1]**

In this session I'll be looking at the basics of what is required for LINQ to Umbraco.
We'll look at how to generate the classes and some suggestions on how to get the best generated class names.

## Session 2 ##

**[Working with LINQ to Umbraco entities][2]**

In this session I'll be looking at the code which was generated from the first session and how we can do some basic interactions. We'll also create our first control using LINQ to Umbraco.

## Session 3 ##

**[Delving into the UmbracoDataContext][3]**

In this session I'll be looking at the heart of LINQ to Umbraco, the UmbracoDataContext. We'll look at what it's role is, and how it can be used in extensibility.

## Session 4 ## 

**[Performance and Caching][4]**

In this session I'll look at how to get the most out of performance and the caching which is built into LINQ to Umbraco.

## Session 5 ##

**[Paging and Control-less forms][5]**

In this session I'll be looking at how easy it is to do paging with LINQ to Umbraco entities. Also with MVC being such a hot topic I'll show you how you can make a form which renders LINQ to Umbraco with no ASP.NET server controls.

## Session 6 ##

**[Outputting XML][6]**

In this session I'll be looking at how you can transform the LINQ to Umbraco entities and generate an XML response, for something such as a RSS feed.
