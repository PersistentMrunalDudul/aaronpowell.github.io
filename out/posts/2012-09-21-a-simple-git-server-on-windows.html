                        <p>With the decision to go to Git from FunnelWeb I wanted to be able to maintain the history of the changes. Since many of my posts have multiple revisions I wanted them to be listed as changesets in Git.</p>
<p>In this post we&#39;ll look at how to get the content out of FunnelWeb (or any content database) and into Git as full history.</p>

                            <p>While <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com">Mercurial</a> still hold a special place in my heart it can&#39;t be denied that <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> has well and truly won the war. Because of this I&#39;ve been using it more extensively in the projects that I work on.</p>
<p>Recently I started on an engagement at work that was using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Foundation_Server">TFS</a> as its SCM, but wanting to avoid some of the pain of TFS 2010 I decided to use <a href="http://gittf.codeplex.com/">git-tf</a>. Things all went smoothly, git was communicating nicely to TFS and children danced around the world.</p>
<p>When the partner who owned the TFS instance rolled off the project the SCM went with them which left me in a pickle, I still had a few weeks left and was looking at the prospect of being SCM-less. For various security reasons I can&#39;t utilise any of the normal hosted SCM&#39;s that I&#39;d go with, so I was left with a problem, I have a complete git history of the project but the only place it lived was on my desktop.</p>
<h1>Making my own server</h1>
<p>Having used Mercurial for around 3 years now I&#39;m quite familiar with the <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/hgserve">hg serve</a> command, this is ideal as you run that and you immediately have a basic Mercurial server running that you can push and pull to. This is exactly what I want for git, I&#39;d have a simple server that I can work against and so can the other developer who was coming in few a few days. Unfortunately <em>there is no such command</em>, you do instead have the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-daemon.html">git daemon</a>, and with a simple command like this:</p>
<pre class="highlighted"><code class="brainfuck"><span class="comment">git</span> <span class="comment">daemon</span> <span class="literal">-</span><span class="literal">-</span><span class="comment">reuseaddr</span> <span class="literal">-</span><span class="literal">-</span><span class="comment">base</span>-<span class="comment">path=</span>. <span class="literal">-</span><span class="literal">-</span><span class="comment">export</span>-<span class="comment">all</span> <span class="literal">-</span><span class="literal">-</span><span class="comment">verbose</code></pre>
<p>You&#39;ve got yourself a git server. Yeah go on, remember <em>that</em> off the top of your head (yes you just type it once in as an alias I know I know :P)!</p>
<p>So I run my command, have my server ready for connections and then shit gets ugly.</p>
<p>As it turns out <a href="http://msysgit.github.com/">msysgit</a>, the de-facto Windows git tools, has some real problems with <code>git daemon</code>. I was continuously seeing this while trying to clone:</p>
<pre class="highlighted"><code class="http"><span class="attribute">fatal</span>: <span class="string">read error: Invalid argument</span></code></pre>
<p>Eventually a clone would go through (it&#39;s only a 10mb repo!) but then you&#39;d get a whole different set of problems.</p>
<p>Again, as it turns out msysgit doesn&#39;t support pushing to <code>git://</code> repositories on Windows. Well that just sucks then doesn&#39;t it, it left us with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet">sneakerneting</a> our <code>.git</code> folder so I could maintain the master repository.</p>
<p>And that got old fast!</p>
<h1>Next up, cygwin</h1>
<p>So now that msysgit was out the next idea was to use <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</a>. I&#39;ve been avoiding installing cygwin on any machines for quite some time now as it really frustrates the hell out of me but I got sent <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/233421/hosting-git-repository-in-windows">this stack overflow post</a> which made it seem quite easy to get it up and running.</p>
<p>Well I followed the instructions and started up my sever and it all seemed good, I could pull from it without any problems. Yay!</p>
<p>But of course it was time for another problem, I kept having <code>git push</code> hang at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7104182/git-push-halts-on-writing-objects-100">100% of writing objects</a>.</p>
<p>Again this seems to be a fairly common problem with git on Windows pushing to cygwin git daemons and to which there&#39;s no decent solution.</p>
<h1>Ditching Windows</h1>
<p>Basically all my research has suggested to me that the idea of trying to host a git server on Windows is just a bad idea. Sure there were other avenues that I hadn&#39;t tried, such as using a network share to store my git repository and push/ pulling over that, but I didn&#39;t want to futz around with network security here for this task (people also suggested using Dropbox but that is nullified by the fact that the source can&#39;t be hosted outside of the local network), I just wanted a damn git server and my only remaining option that I could see was Linux.</p>
<p>Since my machine is running Windows 8 I&#39;ve got Hyper-V built in so that&#39;s one problem down, I didn&#39;t have to install VirtualBox (its installer wants me to trust Oracle, I just can&#39;t do that :P) or VMWare Player or anything like that, just enable a Windows feature. The next question, what distro to use...</p>
<p>Wow, there&#39;s a can of worms you can open, ask people what Linux distro to use... I&#39;ll admit that it&#39;s been quite a few years since I last used Linux so I&#39;m not really up with what the kids are using these days but all I want are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Something light-weight, I&#39;m running a Git server on it, that&#39;s all</li>
<li>Something easy to setup, I don&#39;t have time (or the desire) to really get in and configure Linux</li>
<li>I don&#39;t need a GUI, I&#39;m happy on the command line</li>
</ul>
<p>So <a href="http://archlinux.org">ArchLinux</a> and <a href="http://www.puppylinux.com">PuppyLinux</a> were two of the top recommended distros, but they&#39;d require a bit of setup to get running. Then a colleague of mine recommended <a href="http://www.turnkeylinux.org/gitlab">GitLab</a>, a variation of Turnkey that is basically just a pre-built git server. Sweet that sounds exactly like what I want.</p>
<p>I downloaded GitLab, booted Hyper-V, attached the ISO and kicked off the installer. After being prompted for some credentials to log in and having to use the <strong>Legacy Network Adapter</strong> in Hyper-V (apparently Turnkey supports the standard one but 5 minutes of configuring modules didn&#39;t work for me so I went &#39;meh, legacy it is&#39; :P) my git server was up and running!</p>
<p><em>For the record my VM specs are a 5GB hard drive and it has 512mb RAM dedicated to it. I was tempted to drop it down to 256mb as it really just idles mostly but I&#39;ve got RAM to spare.</em></p>
<p>Next step was to log into the web portal, setup a git project on the server and add my public key and <em>it just worked</em>. Seriously, I was <strong>shocked</strong> that it was that simple!</p>
<p>I even managed to get the other developer (who prefers GUI tools over command line, weirdo!) setup to use <a href="http://windows.github.com/">GitHub for Windows</a> against my GitLab server.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Want to run a git server on Windows? Don&#39;t bother, install GitLab, it takes about 10 minutes to be up and running with that in a VM.</p>
<p>The more I&#39;ve been using GitLab the more I&#39;m liking it, it&#39;s got a nifty little web UI, we can see the repository information, all that fun stuff that distracts you from actually doing work.</p>
