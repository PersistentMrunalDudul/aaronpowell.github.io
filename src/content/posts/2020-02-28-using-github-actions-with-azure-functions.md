I'm back on the [Visual Studio Toolbox show](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox?{{<cda>}}) and this time we're looking at the application we worked with [in the last video]({{<ref "/posts/2020-02-17-creating-functions-with-vscode.md">}}) but add a bit of DevOps on it using GitHub Actions!

I've blogged about how to use [GitHub Actions with Azure Functions]({{<ref "/posts/2020-01-10-deploying-azure-functions-with-github-actions.md">}}) in the past, but that was looking at .NET functions and in this video we'll look at JavaScript Azure Functions.

Enjoy!
