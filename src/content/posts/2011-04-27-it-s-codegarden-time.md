<p>Well it’s that time of year again, the time when <a href="http://codegarden11.com/">CodeGarden</a> is coming back!</p>  <p>As is tradition I’ll be in attendance (3rd year running) and representing a new employer (although I’m not sure if that’s such a good tradition to have upheld…).</p>  <p>This year I’ll be doing two sessions, first is on day 2 entitled <a href="http://codegarden11.com/sessions/day-2/slot-five/collaboration-in-umbraco.aspx">Collaboration in Umbraco</a> and I’ll be talking about how the move from TFS to Mercurial has helped Umbraco grow as well as some other practices that we employ to keep Umbraco as one of the top open source projects in the ASP.NET space.    <br />My second session will be co-presented with <a href="http://twitter.com/alex_norcliffe">Alex Norcliffe</a> and is entitled <a href="http://codegarden11.com/sessions/day-3/slot-two/0-to-hive-in-45.aspx">0 to Hive in 45</a> where we’ll be going on a crazy journey into the depths of the Umbraco v5 API and look at how to plug in your own data model. I’m really excited about this session and hopefully we’ll be able to keep a good amount of it under wraps so that we can totally blow your mind on the day!</p>  <p>Other than this you’ll find me milling around the various sessions, helping out in the hands on labs and just generally causing trouble ;), so feel free to say hi!</p>
