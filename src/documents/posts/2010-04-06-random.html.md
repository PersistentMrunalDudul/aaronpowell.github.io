## Useful Tools ##

### Developer Tools ###

* [LinqPad][1]
 * Best way to test C# or VB.NET without having to create a console application
* [Notepad++][2]
 * My choice for a Notepad replacement. Syntax highlighting in just about every language
* [RedGate's Reflector][3]
 * If you're a .NET dev and don't have this installed get out of my framework
* [Expresso][4]
 * By far my favorite Regular Expression builder and tester
* [WinMerge][5]
 * If you're using SVN, or just need to be able to diff and merge files or folders this is what you want

### Web Developer Tools ###

* [Charles][6]
 * I was a fan of [Fiddler][7] but since using Charles I can't go back. I don't know how they can do so much stuff with Java! Supports all major OS's. I don't care that it's not free, it's completely worth the money

### Administration Tools ###

* [SmartFTP][8]
 * I've used a lot of FTP clients and this is by far the best. Lovely UI, great FTP management, but my favorite feature would have to be the differential uploading. It looks at a file and works out if it should be replaced. Saves bandwidth by not uploading what you don't need to upload. It's also highly configurable. Well worth the money
* [mRemote][9]
 * Need to RDP into lots of machines? This is the best tool I've used for that. Supports all major remote-connection protocols. Having the ability to create folders and "filter down" the settings to the connections within it is great if you need to use the same credentials on lots of machines
