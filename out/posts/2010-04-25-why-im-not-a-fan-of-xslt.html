                            <p>When I first joined the Umbraco team with the goal of bringing LINQ to Umbraco to the core framework there was some excitement and quite a bit of the early excitement was from Umbraco MVP <a href="http://www.creativewebspecialist.co.uk/">Warren Buckley</a>.
And with the recent beta release the focus has come back onto LINQ to Umbraco, myself and XSLT.</p>
<p>While preparing to write this post I was tossing up with the name. Although I&#39;ve entitled it &quot;Why I&#39;m not a fan of XSLT&quot; it would have been just as apt to name it &quot;Why write LINQ to Umbraco?&quot;.</p>
<p>As you read through this post I was you to keep in mind that I&#39;m not someone who is really that good at XPath and XSLT. In fact, my dislike for XSLT is why I wrote LINQ to Umbraco!</p>
<p>But why, being an Umbraco user, don&#39;t i like XSLT? After all, it&#39;s a fairly core part of Umbraco!</p>
<h2>Compile time checking</h2>
<p>That&#39;s right, I&#39;m very much a developer, and very much a compiler-driven developer. Runtime errors really are the worst to try and debug, and that&#39;s what you really get with XPath. XPath is evaluated at runtime (yes, that&#39;s a bit generalized :P), so if you have something wrong in your syntax you wont find it immediately.</p>
<p>Compare that to .NET code, it&#39;s very hard to write .NET code which wont compile. True that you can still get runtime errors, but they are a lot harder to achieve in the scenario&#39;s we&#39;re looking at for LINQ to Umbraco vs XSLT.</p>
<h2>Strong typing</h2>
<p>Again, another example of me being very much a developer, I would much rather look at an object with properties which knows of the type of the data.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re not careful you can mistake the type and then you, again, have a runtime error :P.
The .NET compiler wont let you assign a string to an int.</p>
<h1>Readability</h1>
<p>This one will cause a bit of a stir, but I simply don&#39;t find XPath &amp; XSLT readable. Take these two examples:</p>
<pre class="highlighted"><code class="objectivec"><span class="comment">//node[nodeTypeAlias='home_page']/node[nodeTypeAlias='contact_us' nodeName='Contact Aaron']</span>

ctx<span class="variable">.HomePages</span><span class="variable">.ContactUs</span><span class="variable">.Where</span>(c =&gt; c<span class="variable">.Name</span> == <span class="string">"Contact Aaron"</span>);</code></pre>
<p>My example is very basic, but if you look into a more complex XSLT file (such as many which exists in Warrens CWS package). In fact, in the unit tests for LINQ to Umbraco there is a replication of a few of them (have a look in the source on Codeplex if you want to see them).</p>
<p>A very important component of code for me is readability. When debugging, especially if the code isn&#39;t yours to begin with, readability is a vital component. You don&#39;t want to have to waste time trying to understand what&#39;s going on in the code before trying to solve it.
And if you can&#39;t work out the code properly then there&#39;s a chance you&#39;ll just make the problem worse.</p>
<h2>API Design</h2>
<p>Again I&#39;ll probably cause a stir with this one again but it&#39;s another thing that is very dear to my heart. I am a strong believer in proper API design, and if it&#39;s done wrong then it can make your life hell in the future.</p>
<p>I also like abstractions. LINQ to Umbraco is an example of that... provider model! Here at The FARM we&#39;ve got a great level of abstraction which we use, we don&#39;t pass classes around, only interfaces, which means that your UI is dumb, really really dumb.
There isn&#39;t any business logic contained there, and there&#39;s nothing more complex than a method call.</p>
<p>But too often when I see an XSLT it&#39;s containing more than just UI code. And this isn&#39;t really a fault of XSLT, but of how it&#39;s perceived. When you look at an ASPX/ ASCX people have a different mindset, you don&#39;t put anything really in the front-end file other than the markup as there is a CS file associated which you think to put the other complex code into.
But with an XSLT there isn&#39;t another file, so everything ends up there.</p>
<p>Then it becomes too complex to try and achieve with XSLT <em>cough variable incrementing cough</em> so an XSLT extension is written. And I&#39;ve seen some really scary XSLT extensions, which allow you to do things which just make me want to cringe.</p>
<p>XSLT should only be concerned with formatting data to output markup...</p>
<h2>XSLT&#39;s produce better markup</h2>
<p>Anyone who says that is ill-informed. If you don&#39;t think you can write valid, XHTML markup with ASP.NET Web Forms then you&#39;re not doing it right!</p>
<p>Control Adapters, Repeaters, List View, inline script blocks, etc can all be used to produce what ever markup you so desire.
And it doesn&#39;t take much effort to produce good markup with ASP.NET. In fact, with Visual Studio 2008 it&#39;s really hard to use the standard editor to produce crappy markup.</p>
<p>The biggest problem is ID&#39;s of elements, but you only have that problem if the element is:</p>
<p>Inside a naming container
Set to runat=&quot;server&quot;
And you should only be setting runat=&quot;server&quot; on elements you need server-side access to, but that&#39;s a topic for another night.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So this brings me to the end of another post. Hopefully it&#39;s been enlightening and I haven&#39;t upset too many people :P</p>
