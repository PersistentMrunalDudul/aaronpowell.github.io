    Whether you're a home hobbyist or running a connected vehicle fleet, getting your code onto IoT devices can be a test. Do you go down the route of sneakernet and run flashed memory cards around everywhere or do you look for something a little more automated?

    Come with me as we take a look into how we can apply a DevOps approach to deployment with IoT devices. I'll be using my experience in building my own home automation platform and monitoring tools, and how I automated it so a git push results in a deployment to a device.

    Starting from a 'git push' we'll look at the steps involved in automated builds for IoT devices through to automating the deployment of updates onto the device itself.

audience:
    - IoT solution implementers
    - Home hackers

notes: |
    This talk has grown out of a blog series I did around a home hobbiest IoT project where I wanted to ensure that the approach I was taking to deploying the IoT solution was in line with how I would do any other software project.

    This is a subset of a larger talk, [Home Grown IoT](/talks/home-grown-iot), that focuses just on the CI/CD aspect of an IoT project.
