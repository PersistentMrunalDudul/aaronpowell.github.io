Nearly 7 years ago (seriously, that long?!) I launched a website to [help find what `keyCode` you hit in JavaScript]({{< ref "posts/2010-12-07-whatkey-net-for-your-javascript-keycode-glory.md" >}}).

Well the domain lapsed, the app went offline on the host, and ultimately I didn't
care to much to fix all of that. Well never fear, I've brought it back from the dead!

You'll now find **WhatKey** living at [on my website]({{< ref "whatkey.md" >}}).
I've also done a little tweak to it so that you can see all `keyCode` values at
the same time.

So go forth and inspect those keyboard events!
