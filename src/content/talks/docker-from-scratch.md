hidden: true
tags: ["docker", "containers", "live-coding"]

abstract: |
  Docker's popularity has exploded over the last couple of years, especially in the DevOps space, but unless you've spent a lot of time in that area it can be a confusing technology to wrap your head around.

  So let's step back and start looking at Docker from, well, FROM scratch (and we'll understand just what that means).

  With minimal starting knowledge of Docker we'll look into what it is, cover off all the core concepts from images to containers, volumes to networks, and how we can compose environments. We'll also look at how to use Docker in Dev, not just DevOps and how containers can be useful tools without being something to run production infrastructure on.

audience:
  - People new to Docker
  - People who've never used Docker
  - People interested in containerisation

notes: |
    This talk is a live-coding talk, consisting of 14 exercises shown over the course of 1 hour, covering beginner Docker to advanced usage through network design.

    It can be run shorter than 1 hour by dropping demos as required.
