                        <article class="is-post">
                            <p>A few months back I <a href="http://www.aaron-powell.com/javascript/javascript-quiz">announced a new site</a> I was running called <a href="http://javascriptquiz.com">JavaScript Quiz</a>. When I started to site it was to be done quickly so I chose an out-of-the-box blogging platform, that being <a href="http://posterous.com/">Posterous</a>.</p>
<p>Since then I&#39;ve come to realise that it <em>isn&#39;t</em> the platform I want wanting to go with. One of my main problems with it is its comment management system. Anyone who has submitted an answer to me will know what I&#39;m talking about, the excessive spam which you end up with when I do publish all the answers.</p>
<p>Well because of this I decided to move away from Posterous and go with a new platform. As my new platform I decided that I wanted to use <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> because well this is a JavaScript quiz so why not use JavaScript!</p>
<h1>The software</h1>
<p>When looking at what I wanted to do with the new site I decided I wanted something that was easy to create a site in and also easy to update content it. A lot of people are raving about <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> of recent, which is a Ruby <em>CMS</em> which runs a flat file system website and Markdown as an editing language.</p>
<p>This seemed ideal, JavaScript Quiz isn&#39;t a big site nor is it a dynamic site so something that runs off flat files is very ideal. I&#39;m also quite a fan of Markdown (<a href="http://funnelweblog.com/what-is-markdown">which we use in FunnelWeb</a>) so being able to write my posts in that is very nice an idea.</p>
<p>So I started looking for a Node.js alternative as I&#39;d prefer to use something than write it myself (<a href="http://www.aaron-powell.com/umbraco/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish">I&#39;m a bit over developing a CMS at the moment</a>) and I came across a project called <a href="https://github.com/balupton/docpad">Docpad</a>.</p>
<h2>Intro to Docpad</h2>
<p>Docpad is a Node.js CMS in a similar style to Jekyll written by a guy from Sydney named <a href="http://twitter.com/balupton">Benjamin Lupton</a> (and I like supporting home-grown software so that was a big plus). It&#39;s got a good set of templating engines to pick from so you don&#39;t have to use raw HTML if you want something a bit more cool for your templates (more shortly) and best of all it&#39;s shit simple to use.</p>
<p>You need to install the following <a href="http://npmjs.org">npm</a> packages and you&#39;re off and running:</p>
<ul>
<li>coffee-script</li>
<li>express</li>
<li>docpad</li>
</ul>
<p>You&#39;re better off installing both <code>coffee-script</code> and <code>docpad</code> globally since they both have executables but you don&#39;t have to.</p>
<p><em>Note: I had problems using Node.js with cygwin on Windows, I couldn&#39;t get <code>docpad</code> to install but that seemed to be a cygwin issue as it worked fine on both my Linux and OSX machines, just something to watch out for :).</em></p>
<p>This isn&#39;t a Docpad tutorial, go check out the <a href="https://github.com/balupton/docpad/wiki">docs</a> if you want to learn more.</p>
<h2>Templates</h2>
<p>As I mentioned Docpad has a number of different HTML templating engines available, you can use <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/eco">Eco</a>, <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/jade">Jade</a>, <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">Haml</a> or the one I chose, <a href="http://coffeekup.org/">CoffeeKup</a>!</p>
<p>CoffeeKup is a way of using <a href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a> as a HTML template engine. It&#39;s pretty cool and it means that you&#39;re able to do some really powerful things with the templates and interacting with the document you&#39;re rendering. Plus it means that we&#39;re using JavaScript/ CofeeScript for most of our site (one language to rule them all!).</p>
<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not using any of the CSS templating engines (despite submitting a request for <a href="https://github.com/aeosynth/ccss">CCSS</a> to be included :P) mainly because I&#39;m using <a href="http://h5bp.com">HTML5 Boiler Plate</a>&#39;s css and I don&#39;t want to have to convert it every time I upgrade.</p>
<p>The rest of the CSS is really basic and I&#39;ve just cobbled together so I can get the site live, expect it to be improved as I get more time.</p>
<h1>Fixing commenting</h1>
<p>As I mentioned commenting is something that was really a pain to anyone who was entering the quiz each week as you&#39;d get spammed up with emails (don&#39;t worry, I got them all as well so it was <strong>very</strong> annoying). Good news is that the new site wont have this problem, I&#39;ve gone with <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> for comments (still moderated) which means that it should be much nicer an experience.</p>
<p>From an admin point of view it&#39;s much nicer as well :).</p>
<h1>Hosting</h1>
<p>One advantage of Posterous was that it was a hosted solution so it wasn&#39;t costing me any more and this is something that I wanted to ensure didn&#39;t change. I decided that I&#39;d go with <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> for my hosting since they have <a href="http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/6/22/the_new_heroku_2_node_js_new_http_routing_capabilities/">offered Node.js hosting for a while now</a>.</p>
<p>This means that I am also using Git to store the site and I have it hosted on GitHub at the moment (sorry it&#39;s not a public repo :P).</p>
<p>Because of this I have a nice workflow of being able to edit my content, run it through the Docpad &#39;compiler&#39; and commit in the generated HTML. This then goes up to Heroku and just runs off the flat files.</p>
<p>Ideally I&#39;d not be committing the generated files and have part of the app startup code generate the files but so far I&#39;ve had nothing but trouble getting it working that way. Heroku&#39;s cedar stack (which is where node.js runs) <strong>is</strong> a writable file system but something still seems to be going amiss (and it&#39;s not exactly easy to dig into...).</p>
<h1>Wrap up</h1>
<p>So this is how I&#39;ve gone about the relaunch of JavaScript Quiz. The new site should be active soon (awaiting the DNS to change over :P). I wont be porting the old comments so the old site will stay active. Hopefully I&#39;ve got the redirects all sorted out (yes the 404 page is pretty shit so far :P). Hopefully this provides a nice new home for the site.</p>
