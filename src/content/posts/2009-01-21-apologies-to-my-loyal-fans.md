<p>Just a quick apology to anyone who has tried to submit a comment to my blog since I did the site refresh.</p>
<p>Part of my new code base around the comment submission was not working so I have not received any comment submissions since then.<br>So no, I haven't just been ignoring you ;)<br>It also means I found 2 new bugs in the UIL which I need to address before I can put v1 out!</p>
<p>Please feel free to resubmit your comments as I do enjoy reading them. Also, if you don't have a "thank you" message show after attempting to submit a comment it failed. If you're using Firebug you'll be able to see the web service response and I would like to see it so I can address the problem.</p>
<p>You can drop me an email on:</p>
