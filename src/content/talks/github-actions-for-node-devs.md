    Having a strong, consistent, CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline is an important thing to make sure that you have the ability to release updates to an application or package in a repeatable and error prone way.

    GitHub Actions is a new product in the market to try and tackle this, and help add more to our GitHub projects.

    So how do we get started with GitHub Actions when it comes to creating our pipelines? In this talk we'll dive into the features of GitHub Actions, look at how to create simple deployment processes and then how we can evolve them to do testing across multiple versions of node, introduce release gates and integrate with third party tools for code analysis and test coverage.

audience:
    - Beginners
    - Node developers
    - DevOps engineers

notes: |
    This talk can be adapted for .NET instead of node as the concepts are the same, it's just the difference of using the .NET SDK over node runtimes.
