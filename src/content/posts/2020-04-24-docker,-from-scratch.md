Over the years I've given many talks, but there's one talk that I've gone back to time and time again because I not only really enjoy giving it, but it's always really well received, and that's my talk [Docker, FROM scratch]({{<ref "/talks/docker-from-scratch.md">}}).

The premise behind the talk is simple, we start with zero knowledge of Docker and go through 14 exercises, building on each other, to look at use cases for Docker and then how to apply them. All the exercises are on my [GitHub](https://github.com/aaronpowell/docker-from-scratch) as separate tags, with a `run.sh`/`run.bat` script in the root to execute the step.

And what's more exciting is now you can watch it online as a talk I gave as part of the [Microsoft Reactor Virtual Learn at Lunch sessions](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Reactor-Sydney/).

So grab a beverage, open up a terminal and let's learn Docker together!
