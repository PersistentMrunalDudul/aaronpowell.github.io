:tada: TL;DR [Chauffeur](https://aaronpowell.github.io/Chauffeur) is finally at version 1.0, time to get updating! :tada:

3 years and 11 months a go I [initialised a git repo](https://github.com/aaronpowell/Chauffeur/commit/ba216f1fee020f98a209cce82eebbdd126ea9134) for what would become Chauffeur (the first actual code was [not much later that day](https://github.com/aaronpowell/Chauffeur/commit/b4ef56157991a25043ab435b79a3e0c900c23543)). Over the time I've chipped away at it slowly, added features, fixed bugs, etc.

For a while it's been pretty stable, it did pretty much what I was wanting it to do, so really the only thing missing was the fact that it wasn't a "v1 product".

Well today to celebrate the first Australian Umbraco festival, where I [spoke about Chauffeur]({{< ref "posts/2018-01-21-learn-about-umbraco-cd-at-uduf.md" >}}), I decided it was time to bite the bullet and call it v1.

The one big thing that I did add for the new release was a proper [documentation website](https://aaronpowell.github.io/Chauffeur/) where I cover off getting started and different [Deliverables that ship in the box](https://aaronpowell.github.io/Chauffeur/available-deliverables.html).

Next for Chauffeur is starting to work on some new features to make it even easier to get started and create incremental steps.

Happy automating!
