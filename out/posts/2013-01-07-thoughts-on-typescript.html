                        <p>My colleague Luke Drumm challenged me to implement C# style indexers in JavaScript.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s have a look at how you can do that, and how you can make some very interesting JavaScript objects that are self replicating. We&#39;ll build on the knowledge of using <code>bind</code> and <code>apply</code> from the last two posts.</p>

                        <p>After confusing my colleagues with how to invoke functions with a modifided set of arguments at a single time the next evolutionary point was to confuse them with creating functions that are always called with a different state.</p>

                            <p>When <a href="http://typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a> was announced I was pretty skeptical of it. I&#39;ve been doing JavaScript development for a while now, I know many of the ins and outs of JavaScript development and I&#39;ve never seen any problem with the syntax or the lack of type system.</p>
<p>But like a good skeptic I wanted to reserve my opinion until I had a chance to actually use it. This was the same approach <a href="http://www.aaron-powell.com/javascript/postman">which I took with CoffeeScript</a>, you don&#39;t really know something until you&#39;ve made something with it (and for the record I wasn&#39;t particularly fussed by CoffeeScript).</p>
<p>Well I decided to do this, I wrote a small library called <a href="https://github.com/aaronpowell/mathy.js">mathy</a> and I wanted to share some of my thoughts from having made something with it. Keep in mind this is only a small library so it&#39;s not exactly extensive, but I feel it&#39;s a good start.</p>
<h1>Project background</h1>
<p>I just want to clarify a few things about how I did this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>I used Sublime Text 2 as my editor, not Visual Studio</li>
<li>This is written primarily as a Node.js package but I also want it to work in the browser</li>
<li>The repository should contain the TypeScript source <em>and</em> the output JavaScript, consumers shouldn&#39;t be forced to use TypeScript if they don&#39;t want to</li>
</ul>
<h1>The good</h1>
<ul>
<li>The compiler errors can be nice, caught a few spelling errors and API usage errors through them which I wouldn&#39;t have caught until runtime/while the tests were being executed</li>
<li>Debugging is fine. Even though I&#39;m not debugging the TypeScript (since it&#39;s run as the compiled JavaScript through Node.js I don&#39;t have source map debugging) the JavaScript looks close enough to my original code that it&#39;s pretty obvious as to where I&#39;m at</li>
<li>Being able to create modules using a keyword is good, save a bunch of boilerplate guff</li>
<li>I&#39;ve used a class for part of the API which is very handy and easy to use, but most importantly it’s syntactically simple</li>
<li>It doesn&#39;t try and stop me from writing any of the funky stuff that I actually want to write ;)</li>
<li>Fat-arrow <code>=&gt;</code> is really sweet, I’d never really got into CoffeeScript enough to have built anything much but I can see why those guys rave about it</li>
</ul>
<h1>The bad</h1>
<ul>
<li>If you&#39;re not using Visual Studio it’s kind of a pain, Sublime Text 2 only has syntax highlighting support so you don&#39;t exactly get much benefit, no intellisense or anything</li>
<li>The fact you can&#39;t programmatically use the compiler sucks. Even though TypeScript&#39;s compiler is available as a Node.js package you have to execute the compiler yourself and pass in the input. It&#39;d be nicer if you could just <code>require(&#39;typescript&#39;)</code> instead of what I have to do in the <a href="https://github.com/aaronpowell/mathy.js/blob/master/Makefile">Makefile</a></li>
<li>The way modules are generated can be a real pain if you&#39;re trying to target the browser <em>and</em> Node.js. If you want to go with CommonJS the internal modules they generate create a global variable to store your object in, but that won’t work in Node.js as the variable isn&#39;t exported. If you make it a public module it assumes there is a public “exports” object to attach to which is fine in Node.js but sucks in the browser! I had to have a shitty implementation to get it working that assumes in the browser there is the <code>exports</code> object. You can use the AMD support but it forces you to use RequireJS (or CurlJS or any other loader). It&#39;d be nicer if there was optional AMD support, like how I have it done in <a href="https://github.com/aaronpowell/db.js">db.js</a>, so you can have something that will export as a AMD <em>if AMDs are available</em>, otherwise just be a global object</li>
<li>There seems to be no way to plug a definition file into Node.js so all my unit tests are just written in plain JS which really sucks as I changed the API and didn&#39;t realise until every single unit test failed</li>
</ul>
<h1>The really shitty</h1>
<ul>
<li>The generated code isn&#39;t in a closure scope unless you use a module, which in turn the closure scope is really ridged (particularly from the CommonJS module point of view) which means<ul>
<li>You can&#39;t create interfaces in a function</li>
<li>You can&#39;t create classes in a function</li>
<li>You can&#39;t create modules in a function (ok, I kind of get this one)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>So with all that considered what&#39;s my thoughts so far? I actually do like it, particularly the way the compiler can catch some stupid mistakes. I&#39;d like to try it on a much bigger project, particularly something in Visual Studio to see how well that goes, especially by having things like intellisense working.</p>
<p>The biggest problem I see is the module system, it&#39;s really shit <em>if you don&#39;t do exactly as Microsoft does</em>, and here in lies the problem. If you want to load in third party libraries it really doesn&#39;t work too nicely, you end up with <code>any</code> type declarations around which really isn&#39;t helpful.</p>
