Something that really annoys me is that when people don't use the correct name of a product, and by not using the name of the product completely miss what the product is for.
</p>
<p>
I think that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081216110256/http://adeneys.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">certain people</a> do do it just to stire me up, but for example a product I do a lot of work with is RedDot CMS. But RedDot produce another product, RedDot LiveServer which is <strong>completely different</strong> in what it does.<br>
RedDot <strong>CMS</strong> is just a content management system, and to be honest it's one of the truest examples of a <strong>content</strong> management system. Most common <em>C</em>MS's really blur the line between content management and application serving.
</p>
<p>
Application serving is what RedDot <strong>LiveServer</strong> is about. I'm not a fan RedDot LiveServer (for reasons which I wont go into here) but RedDot CMS I believe is a good CMS product, if you're after a <em>CMS</em>.<br>
But I'm digressing.

Another example, one which I see even more often is SharePoint. I can't count the number of times I've heard "They want a site in SharePoint" or "Their site is built in SharePoint".<br>
Great, fantastic, what can you tell about my car if I tell you it's a Ford?
</p>
<p>
SharePoint is a <em>technology base</em>, the SharePoint family is broken into two major components, Windows SharePoint Services (v3 is current) and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007.<br>
And then within their families there are a number of different versions, depending on what is provided in the project.
</p>
<p>
Similarly when I started development on the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/uil" target="_blank">Umbraco Interaction Layer</a> I spent quite a while thinking about what would be the name of the project. I eventually decided on UIL because of it conveys what the project is all about, providing a layer for better integration/ interaction with the Umbraco API.<br>
Sure it has also been nick-named LINQ to Umbraco, but really the concept of a LINQ-like API for Umbraco is actually a very small part of what the UIL is all about.
</p>
<p>
So next time someone comes and asked for info on how to build a site in SharePoint, or use any other ambigiously named product, just look blankly at them and ask them what said technology is!
