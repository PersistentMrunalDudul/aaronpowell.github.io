## Overview

I've been doing a lot of JavaScript development of recent, and I've always had a soft spot of JavaScript so it was only natural that I keep doing the same things over and over again. As I found that I was doing similar tasks continuously I decided to start working on my own little JavaScript toolbox.

And since I'm doing these things again and again I thought it would be likely that there is one person out there who is doing it as well so I decided that I would release the toolkit I've been building for free.

So this is the landing page for the different articles around the different libraries in my JavaScript Tools.

## Components

* [Core library][1]
* [EventManager][2]
* Unit Testing (Coming soon!)

## Source Code

I've decided to release the source code for this as open source. It's hosted using Mercurial on my BitBucket account. You can grab it here [http://hg.slace.biz/javascript-tools][3] and feel free to use it, fork it or contribute to it :).

### Licence

I've decided to license the JavaScript tools under the MIT license: [http://bitbucket.org/slace/javascript-tools/src/tip/JavaScriptTools/LICENSE.txt][4]
