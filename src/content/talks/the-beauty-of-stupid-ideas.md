abstract: |
  We spend all our days striving to write the perfect code, code that is well thought out and will stand the test of time.

  This is not a talk about that code. This is a talk about all that code you don't write because it's stupid, it doesn't solve a "real" problem or doesn't make any sense.

  We'll explore some of my own stupid ideas, like writing my own number system in .NET or writing an IoC container in JavaScript, what I learnt from these stupid ideas and why exploring stupidity is important.

audience:
  - Everyone

notes: |
  This talk is intended to be a bit of fun by looking at what you can learn from writing code, not because it solves specific business problems or completes a work item on a backlog, but because it helps you learn more about something. Throughout the talk I look at a number of different "stupid ideas" that I've had over the years.
