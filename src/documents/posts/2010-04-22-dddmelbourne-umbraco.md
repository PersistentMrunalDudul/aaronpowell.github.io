A few weeks ago I was noticing a lot of tweets from the people I follow about an upcoming event in Melbourne called [Developer Developer Developer][1]. Interested I delved into it and found that I really liked what they had to offer. It's a free conference on the Microsoft stack which is community driven, meaning that anyone can propose a topic and the community would vote for what they wanted to see.

So I decided to chuck my hat into the ring and propose a session, and to my horror, I mean surprise, I've been accepted!

Well I've booked a flight, still trying to work out where I'm staying and will be around on Friday night in Melbourne if anyone is up for a pre-conference meet and drink.

Don't forget the [NerdDinner][2] on Saturday night too.

### Secrets of an Umbraco Ninja

This is the session I'll be presenting at DDD Melbourne. I'll be looking at how you can use Umbraco beyond traditional content management. I'll be looking at integration with Flash and Silverlight for rich content, how you can get the most out of performance with Examine and dealing with unpublished content.

####Slide decks and code samples

Well DDD Melbourne is done and dusted, it was a good time. Really appreciate the work that the guys did to organise it, and very glad to have been given the opportunity to present.

Thanks to all those who attended my session, hopefully something was learnt from it ;).

As promised here is the slide deck and code samples:

* [Slides][3] (including WebForms MVP stuff I didn't get to :P)
* [Code][4] (DB not included)

####Footnote

I'm currently helping out [Lewis Benge][5] with [DDD Sydney][6], more information on that will come soon.
