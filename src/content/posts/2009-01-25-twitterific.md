<p>Well I'm a whore in all it's forms now (well, actually it's been that way for a while), I'm a twitter-er.</p>
<p>You'll find my occational tweets <a href="http://twitter.com/slace" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I don't really find the appeal of twitter, I particularly don't understand the appeal of using it for something other than an outdated form of IRC.</p>
<p>But oh well, if you want to, there I am.</p>
