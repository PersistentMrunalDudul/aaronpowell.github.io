Pub/Sub is my Hello World, I've done it not [once](https://www.aaron-powell.com/client-event-pool) but [twice](https://www.aaron-powell.com/javascript-eventmanager) in JavaScript and [once](https://www.aaron-powell.com/javascript/postman) in CoffeeScript (although technically that has a 3rd version in JavaScript at the start of the post :P).

Well you may have heard of Microsoft's answer to application-scale JavaScript called [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) so I thought I'd write a pub/ sub library in it too.

    module PubSub {
        var registry = {}
        var pub = function(name: string, ...args: any) {
            if (!registry[name]) return;
                                
                registry[name].forEach(x => {
                    x.apply(null, args);
                });
        }
                
        var sub = function(name: string, fn: any) {
            if (!registry[name]){
                registry[name] = [fn];
            } else {
                registry[name].push(fn);
            }
        }
                
        export var Pub = pub;
        export var Sub = sub;
    }

It's pretty simplistic and I've gone with using the `Array.forEach` method rather than just a normal `for` loop for no reason other than I felt like it.

It could be used like so:

    PubSub.Sub('foo', function (...args: any) {
         args.forEach(x => {
             console.log('argument', x);
         });
    });
    
    PubSub.Pub('foo', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    
    setTimeout(() => {
        PubSub.Pub('foo', 'a', 'b', 'c');
    }, 1000);

See, it's just a pub/ sub library.

There is a few interesting thoughts here though:

-	`function` is not valid as an argument constraint
    - I'm assuming that's just a limitation in the current compiler, you have to use `any` instead
-	They have splat support, `...args`, which is another ES6 proposal and can be quite useful
-	I couldn't work out how to define a `class` or `interface` to accurately represent what `registry` is, since it's really an expando object
-	You always have to do `export var <member name>  = <what to export>`, this annoyed me as I like to define everything up front and then later selectively export. I kept getting errors with `export pub` because I didn't have a `var` in there

# Conclusion

For me it's pretty _meh_ an experience. I've been doing JavaScript for long enough that the features added to _language_ thus far aren't a really compelling reason to go and write it over JavaScript. 

What I have liked is the ability to use ES6 idioms (splats, modules, etc) is nice. 

I'm curious to see what other things it will drive *cough source maps cough* in the future, but for the time being I'm not going to convert all my JavaScript files over.
