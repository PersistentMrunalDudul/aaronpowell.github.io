  Redux has grown in popularity within the React community as an alternative to Flux and a powerful way to manage within your application. From its focus on immutability, pure functions or time traveling, it's become a popular way to back your React applications.

  But Redux is more than a React library, it's a powerful pattern for data management in any kind of application.

  In this session we're going to dive deeply into how Redux works, look at why it's so popular with React, how it can work with any front-end framework and even beyond JavaScript.

audience:
  - React Developers
  - Web Developers
  - Developers using Redux/mobx/ngrx/etc.

notes: |
  This talk is the result of a blog series I did in learning how Redux works and attempting to apply it as a design pattern beyond traditional React applications. The intent is for people to learn about how tools they tend to "just use" work and decide if they really are valuable for what they are building.
