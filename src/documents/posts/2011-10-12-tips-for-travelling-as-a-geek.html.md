Anyone who follows me on [twitter][1] will have probably noticed that in the last two weeks I've been tweeting with a geolocation in Vietnam. If you're really smart you may have worked out that I was on holidays over there!

I had a bit of tech with me, an iPad, iPhone, laptop and 2 kindles so I thought I'd share some of my experiences and tips for travelling as a geek.

# Stay connected

Something that I find is very useful when travelling is having access to the internet. It allows me to do those useful things such as email/ skype my parents, use google maps and check in on foursquare.

So my first pointer when going overseas is work out how you plan to stay connected. Most hotels I've stayed in recently have had free wifi so if that's good enough for you then check out the places you plan to stay. Also a lot of cafe's and bars (particularly ones targeting travellers) offer free wifi so that can allow you your mid-day twitter fix.

The other option is picking up a local sim. I've been to the USA, Denmark and Vietnam this year and all those countries have prepaid sims which you can pick up and drop into your device. For the USA check out things like [GoPhone][2] from AT&T. In Denmark I picked up a sim card from the post office (don't remember who the provider was though) for 99 Danish Krone that lasted for 1 week and in Vietnam I got a sim for a month for the whole of $1USD!

So before you go check out the country and you'll probably find an easy way to pick up a sim card. We found this really useful in Vietnam as it meant we could look up an address rather than relying on shitty maps in guide books, saving an argument or two with the girlfriend :P.

**Before you go for a local sim card make sure your phone is network unlocked. I ended up in Denmark with a network locked phone and my sim wasn't usable in it :(**
