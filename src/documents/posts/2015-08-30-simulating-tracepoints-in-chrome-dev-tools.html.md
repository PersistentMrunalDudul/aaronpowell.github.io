There's a very under rated feature in MS Edge's F12 tools called tracepoints. A tracepoint is like a breakpoint but it calls `console.log` with the statement you provide it. This is really useful want to inspect some state as your application runs but don't want to interupt the application flow by adding a breakpoint, or can't modify your code and inject `console.log` statements (eg: production environments).

Well it turns out that we can easily simulate this in the Chrome dev tools (and I suspect Firefox too, but I don't spend much time debugging in Firefox), and that's by exploiting the **conditional breakpoints**

With a conditional breakpoint it runs what you give it and if it's `true` you'll have the application break, if it returns false it'll continue on unabided. If we exploit type coersion in JavaScript we can call `console.log` as our conditional breakpoint statement and not return anything since `console.log` returns `undefined` which is coerced to `false`.

 Another thing we can do is use the JavaScript [`comma operator`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comma_Operator) which allows us to _chain_ statements together, which each executed and the final of the chain being the returned value. If we combine this with the type coersion we can execute multiple `console.log` statements we can achieve something like this:

Nifty little trick, especially when debugging envuronments we can't access.
