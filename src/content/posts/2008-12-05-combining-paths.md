<p>
Maybe I'm a slow learner or maybe this is one of those beautifully hidden features of the .NET framework but I came across a nifty little static method (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9033/hidden-features-of-c#9401" target="_blank">thanks to this post on StackOverflow</a>), <strong>Path.Combine(string1, string2);</strong>
</p>
<p>
I can't count the number of times I'd written a method to ensure a trailing \, and append one if it didn't exist, all because of some lack-of-knowledge.

So keep this method handy in your knowledge bag for next time you are building file system paths!
