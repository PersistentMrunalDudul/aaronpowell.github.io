Today I upgraded to the latest Windows 10 Fast Ring insiders build, 10158. As with all previous builds this includes some updates to the new Microsoft browser, Edge (which is now officially ships as inside Windows, woo!).

While trying to solve a problem on the site I'm working on I opened up F12 and went to use the profiler, only to be met with this error:

![Profiler Error](/get/f12-error-10158.PNG)

I had a quick chat with some of my contacts over on the F12 team to see if it was a known bug or something to be reported, and they suggested that I restart the **Internet Explorer ETW Collector Service**, which you'll find in your list of Windows Services. For me this service was not running, starting it up and a restart of Edge and the problem went away.

Hopefully this helps someone else out there.
