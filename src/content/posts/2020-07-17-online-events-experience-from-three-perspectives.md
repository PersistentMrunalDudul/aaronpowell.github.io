The world has moved to online events for the time being, and over the past few months I've done a number of user groups, conferences and solo live streaming so I thought I'd share some insights on what I've learnt as an attendee, speaker and organiser of online events.

## Hosting Online

This is an obvious starting place for us, what are you going to do to host the online event, and there's a few factors to consider in this space but I think the most important first decision is what style of event do you want to host and there are two types, conference call or broadcast.

### Conference Call Style

Let's talk about this style of event first as it's what people likely have the most experience with, there's a good chance you're doing one or more calls like this a day already! Tools like Microsoft Teams and Zoom play nicely in this space and have free tiers (or you "know someone with a paid account") to get started with.

As an attendee they are a bit of a mixed bag. Often you'll need to install a desktop/mobile app to use them, rather than just relying on your browser and this can be a bit of a turn off for some people if they can't install something on their device or have concerns about the invasiveness nature some of these apps can have.

Once you're in though, they are a pretty good attendee experience, you can see each other, you can chat, and if feels a bit like you're socialising with others, even if you're all behind camera screens. But this is a double-edged sword from a speaker and organiser perspective.

Since conference call tools tend not to have an owner for the event but are more a communal space, you can end up with some of the common conference call faupaxs, people not muting and limited control over attendee contributions. I was attending a meetup the other day and another attendee was multi-tasking by watching something else, but not on mute, so their audio bleared over the presenter and the hosts couldn't do anything about it but constantly calling out to the person to mute themselves. But let's leave moderation to the side for now as there's a bigger piece I want discuss there.

One thing I really like about presenting on conference call style events is that you can see the audience reactions. Presenting online is **hugely** difference to presenting in person and the main thing I miss is being able to see the audience reactions. Are they losing focus? playing on their phones? falling asleep? Being able to get this sort of feedback helps adjust how you present and even if you can only see a few of the attendees cameras it can be really useful to boost someones confidence.

### Broadcast Style

This brings me to the other style of online events, broadcast style. Tools that fall into this category are ones like Microsoft Teams Live, YouTube Live and Twitch, and sometimes a middleperson broadcast platform will be used like StreamYard or Restream.

From the attendee perspective these can toe the line on being a dreaded webinar, you know the one I mean where the presenter is so far removed from the audience that you may as well be doing something else because it's just downright boring and an engaging experience. For proof that this can work as a community platform you need to look no further than Twitch. While Twitch is primarily used by gamers, there's plenty of developer streams out there too.

As an organiser looking to do broadcast style I can't recommend using a service like StreamYard or Restream. These platforms offer a web interface that you run your event via and push out to anywhere that supports RTMP and this is what services like Twitch or YouTube Live consume a feed via. These two services that I've mentioned both have free tiers that are adequate enough for what most community events would need, with paid plans focusing on features like removing the services watermark, customising the scenes and streaming to more locations at once.

For a user group, being able to stream out to a single location is more than adequate as it helps you focus your community around one place (useful for ongoing discussions post-stream) and the same goes for solo streaming. I personally stream using Restream primarily to Twitch, but also to YouTube Live as it saves the video to my YouTube channel. And this is another benefit of broadcast style, they (generally) make it easy to get a video export of the event to upload somewhere.

The primary drawback with middleperson broadcast services is that there is additional lag between the presenter and the audience, so this can make engaging with the audience a bit trickier. So it's best to play around with destination platforms a bit, but I've found Twitch is the closest to real-time.

But as a speaker, this is my preference because I don't have to install anything new, it's just a browser which I screen share/allow my camera access to and I can get down to presenting. Yes, you do lose the ability to "see" the audience, since there's no other video/audio on the feed (likely just the organisers), but that can help reduce nerves if you're confident in your content but not so much in public speaking. I will say this though, landing a joke when you've got no feedback other than a delayed chat... that's hard!

## Being a Community

Something that is really important to remember when going down the path of online events is that you're a community, whether it's a user group, conference or your own streaming, and that community is the most important part. User groups are places not just where people learn about tech, they are also places where people catch up with friends so it's important to think about how you'll build that in an online space.

### Moderation

I touched on this briefly above, but an important thing to look at when doing online events is how you're going to do any form of moderation. When you're doing events in a conference call style this is inherently challenging as anyone who does conference calls to work can likely attest. You'll have people who forget to mute themselves, people forgetting they have the camera on when they do _whatever_, people wanting to jump in and ask a question as soon as it pops into their mind or worse, someone violating your Code of Conduct.

Of all the conference call platforms I've used, I'm yet to find one that has decent moderation tools that allow you mute or eject people easily, so this is something that you really need to be on top of as an organiser, how do you set the stage for the speaker to be comfortable and successful, while also ensuring that the audience is respectful. Thankfully, the worst I've been involved with is people forgetting to mute themselves and this results in the speaker/organiser having to be louder and shout-ier than them, but to a degree this reminds me of in-person events when people forget how loud they can be!

Broadcast platforms make this a lot easier, first off, you don't have audience audio/video to contend with, so you don't have the unmutted problem to deal with. Also, because they are a bit more asynchronous in their communication, it's a lot easier as a speaker to delay responding to incoming questions until you're ready. Some tools even provide you the ability to create a backlog of questions that you can display on-screen for the speaker and audience, which is really helpful as too often we as speakers forget to repeat a question before answering it.

The chat platforms on broadcast platforms are also designed to have moderation on them, whether it's bots, spam filtering or just giving you the ability to delete messages and mute people. This sort of thing helps to make sure that the values of your community are upheld and enforced.

### Expanding Your Reach

User groups and conferences are a good example of leveraging privilege, I'm lucky enough to work in the Sydney CBD (well, _did_!) and meetups are located there so I could easily attend them. But, they tend to kick off around 6pm to catch people before they go home, and if you don't work in a short stop of the CBD, you're probably not going to make them. Or, if you have family commitments (I have 2 young kids), staying out for a meetup can mean that you sacrifice time with the family. The same goes for conferences, there's cost to attend, time away from work, travel costs if they aren't in your city, and all of this means that there's a lot of people who might want to attend but simply can't.

Being online changes this dynamic though, especially while we're all working from home, as you've removed one of the greatest barriers, travel time. Now your event is accessible to more people, and improving availability of content is a win for all.

My friend Lars put up a poll the other day about online event times:

{{<tweet 1282828866776489985>}}

I'll admit, I was somewhat surprised by the response, that people tended to prefer events at the "usual user group time". The reason that I found this interesting is that it means that the 2nd barrier isn't really a concern to as many respondents as I expected. For user groups I've attended recently, I've seen start times ranging from 6pm through to 7.30pm and my preference is towards the later side of the equation as this has meant I got time with my kids and wife from when work ended to the event started.

So, timing is something that you want to engage with your community on, what works for the majority and what new people can you engage with by having different options of starting time. And this is where having a platform that records content for you can be useful, as you then have the event available for those who missed it without a lot of additional effort on the organisers.

### More Speakers

This is a bit of an extension on the previous point, but by lowering the barrier to attend through reduced travel time and/or more flexible start times, you open up to having people outside the usual radius speak. Case in point, last months ALT.NET Sydney had someone present from Perth.

Now you're able to bring a wider set of voices to your event because you're only really constrained by what people find to be acceptable waking hours as there's no reason someone in Europe couldn't present in Sydney, or someone in Australia can't speak in the US (I'm planning to get up at 1am for an event in a few weeks to attend). So as an organiser you can start looking through your broader networks and thinking of people who you've always wanted to have speak but it's never worked because they were elsewhere in the world.

As an attendee, this really excites me as now I can hear from and engage with people anywhere, learning from them directly in a realtime format, not **only** having the option to watch it online after the fact.

### Keeping The Conversation Going

The biggest loss from moving from in person events to online events is the hallway track. I was discussing this a few weeks ago with some colleagues and one of them remarked that the most successful online events they've seen are the ones that don't focus on the hour/day/week that the event happens, but instead foster an ongoing discussion zone. Doing something like setting up a Slack channel or Discord server in which the speakers can spend time with the attendees and do Q&A, while not replacing the hallway track does go part of the way to giving people more of a community feeling to it.

Another benefit of setting up a server like this is that you can start fostering a community that's broader than just the one night a month or one day a year that your event happens, a helps give people a place that they can continue to converse.

## Conclusion

We're going to be doing online events for a while longer, it's part of the world we now live in and while I don't feel these are a true replacement for in person events there's very much a place which they belong.

For me as an organiser it means you need to go back to the core of what makes a community, fostering that desire to get together and talk about whatever the topic might be. The tech that you use does play a role in making the events successful, so think about what options you have available and how they fit the kind of event you want to run. Conference call style are great for having that person-to-person feel, but they can struggle with moderation, especially at scale.

Online events also open up a range of new possibilities for how you can engage with your community, no longer are you bound by the usual time constraints of getting people before they go home, instead maybe it's possible to be more flexible on when to run so it fits your community.

And don't forget the value in building the community, giving people a space where they can still talk with the speakers and each other, even beyond just the time and place of the event.
