Have you heard, there's an Umbraco conference coming to Australia, [Umbraco Down Under Festival, aka uduf](https://uduf.net)! I'm really excited for this, I've been wanting to see more Umbraco community events happening in Australia, so to see a fully-fledged conference happening is damn cool.

I'm also excited to be speaking at this inaugural event, and speaking about an aspect of Umbraco that I'm very passionate about, how you do continuous delivery.

## What can you expect in the talk?

For this talk I'm going to look back at how we deploy Umbraco solutions and talk about some of the approaches that I've used over the years I've worked with Umbraco, to frame the context of why it's a hard problem to solve.

I'm then going to look at how we can deploy Umbraco projects in an automated fashion. I'll look at a couple of techniques, the pros and cons of each of them in an attempt to ensure that the audience is informed about what approach will work best for their organisation.

Naturally I'll talk about [Chauffeur](https://github.com/aaronpowell/chauffeur) and I've got some cool stuff around Chauffeur that I'll unveil at the event.

Can't wait to see you there!
