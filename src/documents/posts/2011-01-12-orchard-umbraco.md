# Overview

Incase you haven't heard [Orchard CMS][1] has hit [version 1.0][2], and at pretty much the same time [Umbraco Juno (4.6)][3] also has been released. I think this is a great chance to do a bit of a comparison between the two products and hopefully provide people with some insight into both products.

I'm going to only be looking into some very simple aspects of it, doing a 100% feature-by-feature comparison would be really time consuming and probably make for a boring blog post, but never the less, we'll get cracking now.

*This is being written from the point of view of an Umbraco core team member, that means that this may seem bias towards Umbraco but believe me I will do my best to be objective on all points throughout this comparison.*
