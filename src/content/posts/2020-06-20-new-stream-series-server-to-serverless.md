I recently started streaming on [my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/numberoneaaron) and am trying to get into a regular schedule of streaming, so to do that I'm going to kick off a multi-part stream in which we'll look at porting an ASP.NET Core application to a Serverless application on Azure Functions.

The application I'm going to tackle is [Blazing Pizza](https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/blazor-workshop), a workshop from the Blazor team.

I'll be streaming every Friday at midday Sydney time (7pm Thursday's PDT) for anyone who wants to join in. I'm undecided if I'll do it in C# or F#, but the codebase will end up having both implementations, so I might mix and match between weeks on what is done live and which I do between streams.

See you on the stream.
