Just a quick heads up, today I got word that my session which I submitted to MIX, [Razor and Umbraco][1], has got through to open call!

I've previously blogged about using [Razor with Umbraco][2], but if you'd like to see a more in-depth talk, and also a look at how you can use MVC3 with Umbraco today, be sure to vote.

Regardless of whether I get accepted or not I'll be at MIX11, so if you're also there feel free to find me and say hi :).
