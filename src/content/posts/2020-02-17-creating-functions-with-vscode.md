Recently I was in Redmond and was asked if I wanted to record a video for the [Visual Studio Toolbox show](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox?{{<cda>}}). I jumped at the opportunity, not only because I haven't had a chance to record at our studios, but because I've been working on a [hands-on lab to get people more familiar with VS Code and Git](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-javascript-labs/tree/master/1-vscode-serverless). In this lab we fork a repository but then look at how we can do everything else within VS Code, from working with branches, handling merge conflicts and deploying to Azure (and while Damian my chastise me for [right-click deployments](https://damianbrady.com.au/2018/02/01/friends-dont-let-friends-right-click-publish/) there may be another video coming soon ðŸ˜‰).

So [grab a free Azure trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?{{<cda>}}) and check out [the video](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox/VS-Code-Integration-with-GitHub-and-Azure?{{<cda>}}).
