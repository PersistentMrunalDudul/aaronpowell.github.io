I was looking around in the IE10 developer tools today and dug into the `Tools -> Change user agent string` menu and came across some interesting UA options:

![IE10 user agent options][1]

How did I miss that IE10 in Windows 8 RTM has built in User Agents for _IE10 for Windows Phone 8_ and _IE for Xbox_?

That'll teach me to only ever use the _Browser Mode_ options...
