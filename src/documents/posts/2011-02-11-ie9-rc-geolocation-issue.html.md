You've probably already heard that [IE9 RC is available][1], and one of the features that has been included is the [HTML5 Geolocation API][2].

I decided to add that to a fun little website that [Tatham Oddie][3] and I built, [isitbeerti.me][4].

But there's a problem, although geolocation is detected as being a browser feature it fails for me.
