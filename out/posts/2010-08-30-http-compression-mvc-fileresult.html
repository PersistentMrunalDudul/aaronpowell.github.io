                        <article class="is-post">
                            <p>While working on some improvements around the way the styles are handled on my blog (and so they don&#39;t get trashed whenever I update the code with that of the main repository) I decided that I would use <a href="http://clientdependency.codeplex.com">ClientDependency</a> to handle this.</p>
<p>It was quite easy, I added ClientDependency in, re-configured the Views to use it and refactored the CSS so that it was possible to have my CSS along side the other CSS.</p>
<p>All was well and good until I noticed a problem, all the images on my blog were no longer working, they were coming up as broken images. That&#39;s not good, I kind of need them... So I did a bit more investigation, all the download links were also broken. Ok, that&#39;s <em>really</em> not good...</p>
<p>I rolled back source control and it seemed that everything was working just fine before I added ClientDependency, but ClientDependency shouldn&#39;t have any effect on downloads... Should it?</p>
<p>So I did some digging, I was doing everything that should have been done to return a file, hell, it was even more basic than you&#39;d expect:</p>
<pre class="highlighted"><code class="nginx"><span class="title">public</span> virtual ActionResult Render(string path)
{
    <span class="title">if</span> (_fileRepository.IsFile(path))
    {
        <span class="title">var</span> fullPath = _fileRepository.MapPath(path);
        <span class="title">return</span> File(fullPath, _mimeHelper.GetMimeType(fullPath));
    }
    <span class="title">return</span> Redirect(<span class="string">"/"</span>);
}</code></pre>
<p>That looks fine right... right?! <em>Yes, that is fine :P</em></p>
<h2>Hunting for bugs</h2>
<p>Well it was time to start finding the problem, and I had a feeling this was going to be a doosy. I started by disabling ClientDependency and then the images did start working (although my CSS fell apart...), so I was 100% convinced that the problem was with it, but what could it be, I&#39;m working with binary files here, not CSS.</p>
<p>So I crack out my debugger and start stepping through the ClientDependency source and what I first notice is that I don&#39;t know anywhere near as much about it as I would have like to! Eventually I find something a little bit off. Because ClientDependency runs as a HttpModule it fires for the request of the image, well that&#39;s my first red-flag. And I start worrying, if it&#39;s having the image through its pipeline maybe it&#39;s doing something it shouldn&#39;t be.</p>
<p>The next thing I start looking for is a check of the content type, hoping that it&#39;s ignoring the image request... but no joy.</p>
<p>In fact, that&#39;s exactly the problem! The way ClientDependency works is that it adds a filter to the HttpRequest which processes the contents of the page and then in-turn transforms it in the manner of which we require. The problem is, it didn&#39;t ignore the image content type, in fact it turned it into a string, processed it and returned the original string, but now it was no longer a binary object.</p>
<p>Cock...</p>
<h2>He&#39;ll be making a ContentType and checking it twice</h2>
<p>So this is a very obvious problem, we&#39;re not ignoring the images, we&#39;re treating their request as though it is any text/plain request, so I put in a conditional check to ignore the image requests, drop it into my blog and hit refresh. But still no joy... I check again that I did put the line of code in, attach the debugger and spin it off.</p>
<p>To my surprise though the content type property of my response is not <code>image/png</code> as I expected it expected it to be, but instead it&#39;s <code>text/plain</code>. Err, WTF? I spin up Charles and check, nope, Charles is saying that it&#39;s <code>image/png</code> in the browser. I spin up PowerShell and write a simple web request script, again it&#39;s telling my <code>image/png</code>. Well why the hell is the HttpModule telling me otherwise?</p>
<h3>An event by any other name...</h3>
<p>So I start doing some research and realise that we&#39;re using the event <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httpapplication.prerequesthandlerexecute.aspx">HttpApplication.PreRequestHandlerExecute</a> to do the transform, but fun fact is that this is too early in the request life cycle. At this point the Request object is populated, but it&#39;s not been handled, so the object doesn&#39;t have the appropriate ContentType set.</p>
<p>After a bit more research I fine a better event to suite my needs, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httpapplication.PostRequestHandlerExecute.aspx">HttpApplication.PostRequestHandlerExecute</a>, and this is the one recommended when doing filters against the HttpResponse.</p>
<p>Now my ContentType property is set up and I can do checking against it, and the fix now works nicely (there currently isn&#39;t a ClientDependency release available with this fix yet, so if you need it you&#39;ll have to grab it from the source).</p>
<h2>A word of caution</h2>
<p>The reason I&#39;ve made this post is to bring this oversight to peoples attention. While doing the research to fix this problem I looked at a few different libraries which add custom filters (either to remove whitespace, or to gzip responses, etc) and I didn&#39;t find any of them <em>doing content type checking of the response</em>. Generally speaking you shouldn&#39;t need to do this, and in the past it&#39;s not really been needed as it wasn&#39;t as common place to have ASP.NET web applications actually return a file. But with the advent of MVC and the easy in which you can use <code>FileResult</code> it&#39;s something to watch out for.</p>
<p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with using HttpModule&#39;s to compress your response, clean up your HTML or run what ever other filter you may desire, but make sure you&#39;re using one that understands that not everything running through the ASP.NET life cycle can be handled as a string ;).</p>
