    Serverless, like any new technology, can seem like a magic bullet for projects and before you know it someone is suggesting that you rewrite your whole application is microservices distributed in a Serverless model. But is this really viable? Do you really have to throw away everything and start again to leverage the value of Serverless?

    Let's take a look at some of the roles the Serverless can play within our existing solutions from how it can be the backbone of a event-centric model, to monitoring infrastructure, to offloading computationally expensive operations from our applications main thread.

    In this talk we'll go beyond Azure Functions and look at the breadth of Serverless offerings to help us scale our solutions without the dreaded rewrite.

audience:
    - Developers maintaining existing apps
    - People with Serverless experience
    - People wanting to get started with Serverless

notes: |
    Some of the content covered here is from content delivered in Microsoft Ignite The Tour sessions around event-centric systems and using other parts of the Azure Serverless platform like Event Grid and Logic Apps, while other parts will look at scenarios driven from customer engagements.
