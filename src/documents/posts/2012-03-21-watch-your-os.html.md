Today some of my colleagues were trying to integrate [csslint][1] into the build process of a project using the [nodejs package][2] but they kept hitting an issue:

    npm ERR! Unsupported
    npm ERR! Not compatible with your operating system or architecture: csslint@0.9.7
    npm ERR! Valid OS:    darwin,linux
    npm ERR! Valid Arch:  any
    npm ERR! Actual OS:   win32
    npm ERR! Actual Arch: ia32

So I had a crack on my machine and it worked **just fine**. This was rather confusing until we compared versions. I was running version *0.6.11* where as they were running *0.6.13*. This didn't make sense, why could I install it but they couldn't?

I put on my detective hat and went hunting, the first thing I found was that there is an OS restriction in the package.json file:

    "os": ["darwin", "linux"],

This doesn't include `windows` anywhere, but it also doesn't explain why it worked on my Win7 x64 install but not theirs.

Then I went back and checked out what changed between the two versions of Node.js, in particular what changed with npm.

That's when I came across the [release notes for 0.7.6][3]. While true this is for the 0.7.* unstable branch and we're using the 0.6.* stable what's worth noting is the first change for npm version 1.1.8:

> Add support for os/cpu fields in package.json (Adam Blackburn)

I then looked at the 0.6.13 release, it's using npm 1.1.9. Compare that to 0.6.11 which used npm 1.1.1 and I think we've found our issue. In the change between the two Node versions we've got a new npm version which *supports something that wasn't supported before*!

A simple [fork and pull request][4] and the problem is solved and now we have to wait for the next version for csslint to be published.

# Lesson Learnt

npm now supports the OS (and CPU) package.json property from [CommonJS][5] so make sure you check that properly!
