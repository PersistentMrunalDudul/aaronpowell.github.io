Well I release the <a href="/web/20081207070804/https://www.aaron-powell.com:80/blog/november-2008/umbraco-interaction-layer---preview-3.aspx" target="_blank">UIL Preview 3</a>, and in my work&nbsp;to support&nbsp;Umbraco v4 Beta 2 I found a change with the GetAll property signatures. 
</p>
<p>
As you may notice reading the comments in my blog post the long-reaching effects of the change&nbsp;were not really considered and it actually resulted in a lot of breakages! 
</p>
<p>
Well the Umbraco team has release <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081207070804/http://umbraco.org/23648" target="_blank">Umbraco v4&nbsp;Beta 2, Take 2</a>&nbsp;which corrects the issue, but subsequently left the UIL not working in the latest official v4 release! 
</p>
<p>
So I've updated the UIL and celebrated it with a <a href="/web/20081207070804/https://www.aaron-powell.com:80/media/1529/umbracointeractionlayer.preview3.v4.2.zip" target="_blank">Take 2 release of my own</a>. 
</p>
<p>
This release is just a recompile of the v4-targeted package, if you want the v3-targeted package use the original <a href="/web/20081207070804/https://www.aaron-powell.com:80/media/1453/umbracointeractionlayer.preview3.v3.zip">UIL Preview 3 release</a>.
