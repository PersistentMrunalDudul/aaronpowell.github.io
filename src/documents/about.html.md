## About Me ##

Hi, my name's Aaron Powell and I'm an alcoholic. Or wait, is this the right forum to be talking about that? Hmm...

Actually I'm a 20-something year old software developer living in Sydney Australia. My main development platform is ASP.NET, both Web Forms and MVC.

I've been developing professionally since 2005 where I started at [Next Digital][1] in Melbourne. I then moved to Sydney to take up a position at [TheFARM Digital][2]. Towards the end of 2010 I left TheFARM and joined [Readify][3] as a Senior Developer and Technical Specialist (Web).

Throughout my few years as a professional developer I've been spread across a number of CMS, from OpenText (formerly RedDot CMS), Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007 and most prominently [Umbraco][4].

I've been on the Umbraco core team since 2009 when I was asked to join so I could produce LINQ to Umbraco, for the upcoming 4.1 release. [In September of 2011 I was stood down as a committing member of Umbraco][5].

I also contribute to several other open source projects:

* [Examine][6]
* [Client Dependency][7]
* [ASP.NET WebForms MVP Contrib][8]

## About this site ##

This would be about version 7 of www.aaron-powell.com, and it's the first for quite a while that I haven't used Umbraco as the blogging engine.

I was looking to move into using a MVC-based blogging engine for quite some time now, but the problem was that I don't really have the time to work on it. Luckily the work was done for me!

Brisbane developer [Paul Stovell][9] created a blog engine which I really liked the look of called PaulPad (you can see more information in his [Behind PaulStovell.com][10] post), so I downloaded the source off his SVN server and got playing.

I wanted to do more work with MVC2 though, and since PaulPad is only MVC1 I set about upgrading it, I also upgraded it to the latest version of Autofac (which gave me [no ends of grief!][11]), but after about a week of playing I finally got it working again.

Currently I haven't migrated many of my posts from my old website, but I'm going to keep it active for the foreseeable future on [legacy.aaron-powell.com][12]. Commenting will be turned off there as well.

So have a dig around, it's a bit of a work in progress at the moment, but so far I'm really quite happy with the new platform. Paul did make a very nice platform.
