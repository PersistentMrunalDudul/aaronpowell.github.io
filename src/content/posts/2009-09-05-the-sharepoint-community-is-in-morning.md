<p>
So I've just sat down to read over the pilling up blogs from the last few days when I came across <a href="http://www.u2u.info/Blogs/karine/Lists/Posts/ViewPost.aspx?ID=35" target="_blank">this one</a>  from Karine Bosch.
</p>
<p>
Patrick Tisseghem passed away earlier today. Anyone who's not familiar with his name will most likely be familiar with his work through U2U, blogs, articles, books and training courses.
</p>
<p>
I was lucky enough to have met Patrick last year at a 5 day SharePoint training session, it was a good great course, despite the disaster with the training material not arriving nor the books being available at the time.
</p>
<p>
I have a copy of his first MOSS 2007 book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Microsoft-Office-SharePoint-Server/dp/0735623686/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1220616482&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Inside Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007</a> and his second book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Index-Search-Engines-PRO-Developer/dp/0735625352/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1220616482&amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank">Inside the Index and Search Engines: Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007</a>, sounds interesting as I find the search engine in SharePoint such a pain to get my head around.
</p>
<p>
His sudden death is a tragic loss to the SharePoint community and I wish the best for his family and friends in this troubled times.
</p>
<p>
Farewell Patrick, I'm glad to have had the chance to meet you.
