It's that time of year again, it's **conference time!**. I'm excited to announce that I'll be coming down for my 4th(!!) [DDDMelbourne](http://wwww.dddmelbourne.com) and the [overall agenda](http://www.dddmelbourne.com/agenda) looks quite exciting!

This year the organisers have decided to add a workshop track as well as the three presentations, and when they asked me if I'd do a JavaScript workshop I jumped at the chance.

The workshop is going to be on an aspect of JavaScript that I'm quite passionate about and we'll be getting really hands-on and mostly just writing code for the hour, so bring your device and get ready to code.

So [register now](http://dddmelb4.eventbrite.com.au/) before it's too late (ticket's are going quick).
